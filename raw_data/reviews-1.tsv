d242fdc9-772b-4d97-94bb-dabdec22ebe7	5	Worked like a charm! Everyone was amazed by the candle, especially my daughter!
05d4b845-1772-4f02-8dcc-b0ef4c1e06f8	5	These are super fun!  Easy to figure out true measure. Super quality. Helpful for bulk vitamin powders and for my herb teas.
b848c565-1a0b-4810-9dfc-9a537cfedcbf	3	I liked it but it is too big.  Beautiful piece that falls off my hand.  It's made for someone with an 8.  1/2 wrist at minimum.
ae56ebfe-0abf-4a55-88fc-d838b834d4ae	5	This is great. I use it all the time.

58ded8c4-fed8-4f3a-a6e7-ad6229a3d69b	5	FAVORITE plugs I own. I get compliments Everytime I wear these. They are kinda difficult to screw on, but totally worth every penny.<br />Got them in a size 0g
a85b1a5c-b30f-4251-bedd-7c6eebc00961	5	Bought this for the GF. Nerd! But she loves it.
9873538d-d347-4476-976c-c7c9038c31a8	5	THEY ARE LOVELY
07058385-de95-4456-adb8-efa70f44de6f	4	Great
abc0216b-c7cc-4435-8355-a5016c4d19c5	5	Beautiful!
b88b4e1f-064f-444d-8ce1-70a3ca272536	3	I didn't like this product either.  I purchased the lid rack, this and one other.  For me, the space this saves isn't worth removing a shelf in my cabinet for.  If you have a cabinet with no shevles, this could be a great resource.
2fcabc7e-ba02-4519-aa47-624ce3939d86	5	Honestly even more beautiful than the picture!!! My boyfriend gave this to me as a replacement for the ring he bought last year,  it was silver and 5 months later I had an allergic reaction.  I was devastated and never thought I would be in such aw. Then I found this.  It's stunning!
40a4744f-fa55-490f-a115-f9adefcf1243	2	Center gem fell off when I took it out of the package, and the gems were off center. I liked the bright silver color metal part of it though.
74a1fd67-30d1-4f36-bd0a-845c65ac72bb	1	Horrible quality, I have yet to wear this item and after just sitting in the black box it arrived in, it is tarnishing! Of course the return window is within 30 days, it takes less time than that for  this item to become useless and damaged.  Never again!
be29ab4d-6bd4-4c57-aa3e-4f5d0ae48dad	5	Awesome!.  I typically cut everything and put it into my salad.  Then one day while at Subway I got a salad and was impressed by their double bladed mezzaluna type knife. Unable to find a good one, I elected to purchase this one.  This is very sharp, and cuts extremely well.  I typically cut cucumbers, plum tomatoes, pepperoni, in a bowl then add the spinach, cut some more then add the feta for a very healthy greek style salad. I use one bowl and this knife.
86bd9545-60b4-4aee-8b76-1522fe2851aa	4	Very good product.  I bought glass because I do not like drinking from plastic.  Not healthy.  I was disappointed that the insert that holds the fruit is plastic!  Otherwise it is a good product.
648bd04d-33c7-4aa0-a930-b869877c41cf	5	This juicer is the easiest and most comfortable juicer I have ever used. I have arthritis in my fingers and have had no difficulty using this juicer for squeezing my fresh lemons every morning. It is extremely easy to disassemble for cleaning and cleaning is as simple as rinsing under the faucet. It really is very quiet when running and the parts are sturdy and well made.  I highly recommend this juicer for its simplicity of use and cleanup.
1ec890c5-3cf5-40fa-8269-f08b9598b6c9	5	THESE ARE PERFECT FOR DISPLAYING JEWELRY ---
5c243374-a211-4fea-b6ae-1cf6a2b3a70e	3	Love the look of the pearl and the chain, elegant, but chain needs work.  After wearing it ONE TIME, my husband was cautiously taking it off and the chain broke off the clasp.  It can not be fixed.  Disappointed and angry.  I searched for a very long time for this and do not why they would put that lovely pear on such a piece of garbage chain.  So bear this in mind if you want it.
b5a45c1d-0012-427f-9ae4-45e474817607	5	Product arrived as expected. Received product for discount to provide honest feedback. Aplus shipper and great product. Cant complain at all. Will buy again at full price.
c93b5303-9f8d-47d7-bf06-ebed29783970	5	Great quality!<br />Received in nice gift box.
0852e47c-d35f-4a5b-8745-9150b5bc4ff4	1	Can't find Kue cup without ordering off line. Shame on you Keurig for selling this model.
32f5d10e-79a8-4c3e-a1e2-fc8becc3aa63	3	Good buy if you want the tapers. The set of plugs I received were very cheaply made and the paint rubbed off right away, although they had great costumer service and promptly sent me another set, these new ones seem to be of better quality but still are quite worrisome considering the previous set.
5eaeecbc-eab9-4259-bb3d-787aaa302a86	5	Great
01f74619-4b1a-4597-b71a-dd8b23557fe2	5	Np problems, works great. Use it nearly every day and don't have to heat up the kitchen with the regular oven in the summer months.
75e260c3-8f6e-49b5-a938-cc77539757ce	3	Last year I bought my first ever ceramic knives (Kyocera) and they were fantastic!  Broke one, so I ordered this one as a replacement.  I was thinking that ALL ceramic knives would be just as sharp as the Kyocera.  Wrong.  This one cuts OK, but on tomatoes (the definitive test of sharpness) the MoiChef takes considerably more downward pressure on the draw stroke to pierce the tomato skin than the Kyocera.  I'll keep the MoiChef and use it, it's fine, it's just not 5-star fine.
f2ee0a94-e8c5-4792-8b34-1d89ec6974bc	5	Delicate and cute.. Sits perfectly on my neck.
ac4b5d90-10e8-4f4f-ba14-84dc5596c5f8	3	Fits well, is a scorpion.... honestly the drawback is that it looks like 99 cent bling with the fake jewels. Should have stuck to silver ('silver').
729d0bad-c5a0-4527-a8e1-f1b5360e0a41	5	These are bigger than I thought! I love them! Really well made with a little weight to them! I want to buy more as Christmas presents!
30a86aff-0853-445a-9fe4-4fe5b3ffb2c6	5	I really like these, but they're a little heavy. But I bought two other pieces that I thought would be bad, so I got a pack of Lobe Wonders along with this to prevent my ears from stretching out. I was a little concerned that the backs don't screw on, but I haven't had any problems. They're products are very well made and have fared well against frequent wearing and swapping. Thank you!!!
1e544e10-435e-4ac8-8f71-20a77f29a319	4	We love the Corelle Livingware Country Cottage set of dishes.  We don't need anymore cups, so this combination was exactly what we needed.  It can go from the microwave to the dishwasher which makes it is so convenient and easy!  My wife is going to order another set.
d3a3902c-1d7c-403b-be04-d2b4977ad488	5	As others have said, large! But also a good weight. I've been wearing them all day and my gamer friends love them.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant, and the simple design both gets the point across and perfectly shows someone jumping through a portal. NOW, whether they're jumping through your head, or AROUND it, is up to you... :D
eff8339f-1241-4d9f-880c-24a4b8fab713	4	Nice ring for the price.
58ecb5b4-505b-4039-b693-193602b1f2d3	4	So far so good! I've cut up whole chickens and straight through bone with no problems. I only wish the blade was sharp all the way to the handle.
2448896b-0fb9-4ff4-86d1-34bd22cfc83a	5	This is great for batter! The edges scrape the bowl perfectly :)
e862b1ca-b05c-40e8-ae6e-cbf69c496088	3	A great deal but a few mistakes were made with the order. I got the wrong size tunnels with the 12 mm tapers. Also almost everything was labeled the wrong the size but it was easy enough to figure out which was which. Compromises for the price I guess.
c5e35075-f603-4836-a661-ac058f53a408	5	I received this in 2014 it was bigger than what I wanted so I don't wear it but i needed a locket and I use it for that purpose by all means it was only two day shipping so that was nice
f9e651bb-c0b6-4c66-a519-8ddec7b1242c	4	This is a good pan to have if you want to take it camping or to cook with under your broiler. I cooked a London broil in this and it came out perfect in the broiler. Otherwise stove top cooking in this would be a pain because it is a pain to clean in between the grooves
77dea662-ab6d-470f-8ee8-54d5d4f4cf8a	1	Too large, and far too ugly.
b444528f-6ccb-47ea-a715-b3e5f09d8336	5	I just love this RubyRed baroque necklace.  For the price, the craftsmanship is just beautiful and the quality is great. I plan to order more of my jewelry from &#34;HisJewelsCreations&#34; through Amazon. Delivery was spot-on too.  B
7f95d3f7-c7ac-48b2-9b9c-f19de2c05da5	1	not true to the picture very dull no shine and looked bad it broke inside the envelope before i even opened it the envelope was folded and put into mail box. bad quality. not worth the $10 better off going to the mall and getting something there.
4c4f713e-c6c4-43d3-a86f-641e474e9681	5	Pricey, but wonderfully crafted. The grain size is so easy to adjust for both the salt and pepper,
38661088-cda4-40cb-9194-4a83e48f6e8b	1	I was enthusiastic about these shredders which were advertised as being so well made that I could proudly pass them down to my children. I don't think so.  Mine is showing rust spots after being washed once.  It looks ugly.  My husband took one look at it and said, &#34;I'll just use the old one instead.  Throw this one away.&#34; I did.  Don't waste your money on this.
a6bb8001-beca-4faf-a089-5d281c0fdb29	5	Super happy with the quality of the material. It's light and comfortable. There's a zipper so nothing falls out. Lots of room and pockets to find essential things, like keys, fast. I would definitely buy another in a different colour.
acccab8c-0e03-4f3f-9fcf-ca8ea592bbb4	5	Love these! These look great and are exactly what I hoped for.
1bb383aa-237f-4d5e-a77b-0e5ba401580b	5	Perfect-big -love them
aeff2093-48b7-4792-a0fd-9a568f4e4f2b	5	good
38d22f54-ad69-43c9-80e7-b61458b74806	2	Green plating comes off easily as a verticle labret if you mess with it alot with your mouth.<br /><br />I'd imagine it would work better as an eyebrow ring.
d19c5ad6-6ac5-4152-85a1-fcd64d22dd78	5	Bought these bottles for pancakes and waffles. Works perfectly for no-spill pouring and stores in the fridge for next day use.
8b68e9fb-0949-428b-8e07-de3f1eaf9ac7	5	I love this tray. I have had the cheaper ones but you may as well spend the money and get a good one and this is worth it, I would definitely buy this product again.
4afb5841-1740-4a93-87c7-15bf5e16bb55	3	I was disappointed in this carafe. I expected it to hold ice water all night with ice still in it the next morning. It's a nice pitcher, but it doesn't do the job I expected. I had had a thermos type pitcher that had a glass lining inside. It got broken, and I was trying to replace it. It held ice all night.
ef979f4e-2f2f-41b1-8499-79a6a7db6919	5	Love these, I needed something for the hubby's ears that would be small enough not to cause a problem at work!  The beads fit so snug I don't even worry about them coming off!!!
aba76ebd-ebcf-4572-bc5d-6b31c9648770	3	The heart came out very odd and I was unable to tell that it was a heart at first. The necklace fit perfectly, however, and I'm glad to see a choker actually fit as well as this one did.
83889d18-5d42-473a-9224-88b56083e871	3	These are cute colors, but the material is much thinner than I expected.
121b52cf-9aa4-4193-8bb4-f404889c45ec	5	Not really much that can go wrong with a bag. No rips or tears, pictures were nice, not screwed up or anything
ed529f77-b0c2-4cbb-8328-e986bc8d9f31	5	I've had food processors for years going back to the Robot Coupe. Finally decided to bite the bullet and spend a few extra bucks and get this big one. I love it. It is so fast it took some getting used to so as not to turn everything to mush. Bread dough in seconds; kapusta in even less time. Combine this with a Kitchenaid mixer and you don't need anything else for food prep. The only down side is after washing in the dishwasher, it is impossible to get some parts of the bowl dry. I try to put everything away right out of the dw, but this I have to air dry. Not a big deal, but a minor inconvenience.  Great product, wish I had bought one years ago.
c57dc5ea-c3bc-4804-9930-8dc62ba17ec9	3	Got these to match my prom dress, they were not the correct size they were a little smaller not to big but broke easier thank other glass pairs I've had.
61e37f16-4a97-42d1-a7d0-00d67f32c2d6	5	Love my new tongs! I am an avid cook (professionally trained) and I have to say these are a great addition to my kitchen. They rest off of the counter so I don't  have to worry about a messy counter nor do I need to worry about anything &#34;extra&#34; contaminating the food I am preparing. It's a win win. I think this will be a great item for gift giving (already bought a second set for my mom)- a great set -terrific value too.
006843a1-1269-4c0a-8528-46dbf0bc7d45	5	These pearls are very pretty! You get a blue/grey, white, and pink. What I really like about this set is that the outside circle, the diamond part, is removable so you can use it with any color pearls.
bf9e2e4d-b754-4815-b94e-20cf8d48bd84	5	Awesome product! Keeps your drink cold all day!
417ac3b9-2c51-45fb-abad-40eebff2da27	5	I am truly enjoying my French Press.  Received 3 gifts with the press and they are the best.  I have chosen for now Turkish coffee with Cardamom and sugar.  It feels like a special holiday every time I use my French Press.  I want to purchase more as gifts for friends and family, this French Press is wonderful.<br />I also appreciate the seller MSG Market Source.  They have treated me royally throughout the complete purchase.  When deciding on the right french press for me, the description was great, and true to i'ts word.
08bb0486-00ef-41c7-9455-35f74533a81b	5	Gorgeous bracelet. Comes with the alex + ani card and bag, no box. As far as I can tell this is authentic. Purchased as a birthday gift and the recipient was very happy with it.
bdc1ba83-b804-4899-9a8f-0d38d9c7551e	5	Fell in love with these in Italy and happy to find one at a good price here in the US.  Keep in mind that the cup size is for espresso cups.  I make the 6-cup size for one big mug of good, strong coffee.
7e8331aa-24ae-4a07-9025-d4d9032b9e14	3	I like the looks of this very much, but the butter gets smashed along the sides a lot since it is just big enough for one stick.  After a few months and setting on the counter too hard the top snapped off.  Won't buy another like it.
0316627d-94e5-4861-a5f8-b0c466e52fc6	4	This is pretty simple - a one - piece tool for cutting cheese. I got it because the wire cheese cutters I use always break. This is sturdy, so I don't see that being a problem. It is a little narrow, so it can't cut cheese blocks that are as wide as my wire cutter could, but I typically but smaller blocks anyway.
f9904b8f-90ec-40e7-b306-88e495a1245a	5	Love this product. I even ordered two more for friends. My first one broke when I dropped it, but it was my own fault. As a nursing mom this is a great way to keep taking in fluids. I fill it every morning and keep it with me thru day.
b149f4fb-7dce-43ba-bbb5-fd430fc2137a	5	Dangerously sharp.  I nearly lost a finger!  Can't recommend.
937ade8d-9066-451b-9564-abccf02fd0ab	5	Nice addition to the candy bar. Everyone loved the design. Super cute!
1cafbe86-69ef-4347-a307-50c6daae1c5a	1	I wish I could contact seller to tell them upset I am about this product .. I bought this a few months ago and today the pug charm snapped off my bracelet the metal loop snapped right off ... and of course my window to return expired on Aug 16th please do not buy this ... it is cheap and obviously they know it will brake so they give you a small window.... if I could give no stars I would !!!
ba4b297e-d05f-482c-8b5d-ff22677e3c0d	2	I am not in love with this. Very stiff. Not worth the money.
fa7afb0f-ab84-4f25-a0ab-6f5088b16956	4	Love the infuser water bottle! The infuser itself is a little hard getting out at first but other than that I love having flavor in my water.
3251384b-c0f6-4665-8bb7-b1c7fb675369	5	Love Alex and Ani - great quality and I love the cross.
7614e007-b58c-452a-bc04-ee5a7dc46b99	5	Love it.  Had it on my wish list for quite awhile, then decided - why not????
b0279e96-43f4-4d78-9d6c-2cadebd4c2d4	3	NOT GOLDENROD! They are orange! Bright orange. Not even close to yellow. So disappointing! The packaging says goldenrod, but they definitely are not. Now we have to scramble last minute for yellow crepe!
6a017d6e-ac66-4a07-a6fc-36103e5bf104	3	Before/after testing with the [[ASIN:B00IDBZ1A2 iSpring TDS3 - 3-Button Digital TDS Meter features Automatic Temperature Calibration, Extra Temperature Button, Carrying Case, 0 - 9990 ppm Measurement Range, 1 ppm Resolution]] gives me Total Dissolved Solids of 174 ppm before treatment, and 110 after, measured roughly a week after changing the filter.<br /><br />This version really is much better with not releasing all kinds of carbon particles. I just wish it took more of the crud out of our nasty tap water. Will look at similar affordable solutions. If they're no better, I'll come back and reassess this rating.
a9baa1a2-e6f8-438b-a072-4c70c83523eb	1	We enjoyed this microwave for about 2 years and now the door has crumbled.  Only adults used it moderately and it was cared for.  It started a year ago with a few cracks in the plastic and now the door is coming completely apart.  A replacement part is $90.  Don't waste your money on this brand.
c642e7c7-ed0b-4f6f-b950-2eff102ebd87	5	Love it!
bdf127cb-abc6-431b-83a2-4d16e2630e91	1	cheap quality
c003f836-6f43-4e74-ac74-59c3ac000c69	5	This is a very cute simple set... Would make a good gift for a child or adult.
b135eabd-01e8-433e-92aa-d19d612a10e8	5	I have used a lot of insulated containers in my 40 plus years of drinking coffee and teas.  This is by far the leader of the pack.  Not only does it keep coffee hotter for much longer then any of the others I have used, it is by far the best looking.  To tell the truth, I am not interested in size, shape, or anything else other then how long does my coffee stay hot.  Anything else is just a plus.  The best thing about this is it doesn't drip and is super easy to clean.  Only rubber and stainless steal come in contact with the beverage. We will be buying another one or two soon for camping and a wedding gift.
50088cca-d9a7-4387-85ed-e8a88e54ee50	5	My husband purchased this as an early birthday gift for me, and it just arrived today. The pendant is sturdy, solid metal, with two sides that you can show. One side is shown in the listing, the other side is a smooth, silvery pentacle that looks elegant and very Witchy. The chain is simple, but comfortable, fits well, and when worn, the pendant lays comfortably on my chest with no issues. Very happy to have this pendant, and would recommend it to others looking for a high quality necklace to represent their faith.
2ff59077-3893-4bec-8751-27346df40bbe	5	Great product delivered on time.
1c8a53d4-a21b-4ed2-b9ff-0ef9f80fca1e	4	Bought this for my best friends bachelorette and she loved her veil tiara. It's cheap material but ill only wear the stuff once anyway. So it's a good deal for how much you get.
4750c8da-6ed6-430c-8549-c379aad60fc8	5	Adorable paper plates!  Used them for my daughter's ballet themed baby girl shower!
81af181d-0181-454e-a61f-22342934aa93	5	This is awesome and super easy to use.  I use it in a 32 oz mason jar which creates a great cold brew with my favorite coffees (significantly less acidic flavor profile than the same coffee brewed via percolator or French press).
1ab82219-e349-4c60-a318-d5790975927f	4	I would have given it a 5 star rating but it had a missing stone and one of the other stone was in the bag so I glued it back on but other then that it is a gorgeous necklace. People kept asking me where I bought it.
ca7c5fc9-6341-4b8d-b4ca-8439c6f2a0a0	4	Exacty as stated.  They server their purpose well
33c16eae-4369-4f70-b35b-585c5e614244	5	Beautiful . loved the color and everyone loved it
88a793e1-35fe-4589-a0e7-c2d26c5672ca	3	So sad it's made so poorly. Everyone comments how cool it is but it chipped the first time I used it. (I am not rough on dishware.) Continued to use and the second time another big piece of the paint fell off. I really like the mug. But it may explode the next time.
986cc550-bb1a-45af-abee-4a687742e794	1	doesn't work well wtih Keurig. Grinds go thru
9c272525-3001-4bba-9a20-67fddd538db5	5	it is beautiful and I really love itã€‚ it will be even better if the blue paper can be changed by fabric or something more strongerã€‚
963a91fe-8d00-4817-b437-558ff47d8cd6	4	Fun, good color combo, and good size; they show up. The stones are a tad bit loose, but overall a nice piece of costume jewelry.
a38908a9-802e-47e1-b835-adf1c5ed7268	5	It feels so comfort and so cute...
990a94cc-6622-45be-85d1-e2fa4cae4a6d	5	I bought this set to work with a new Induction cooktop, and it's perfect. The only pan I am missing is a small skillet for eggs - but otherwise all needs are pretty much covered. It's a good entry level cookware set that seems like it will last some time with average use. I'm very pleased.<br /><br />And for your information, this is the induction cooktop I am using it with. I am also very pleased with that purchase:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045QEPYM?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4
c5986af2-192a-4d2d-9323-aceee89ec8f6	5	It's a Foreman!
b826c9ad-fd6b-4089-a6c3-d399975098d6	5	Very nicely made. Apparently too cool for me, my daughter snagged it and has been wearing it. I've got to negotiate to get it back for special occasions :-).<br /><br />One caveat. The chain it comes with may be a little small if you are a guy with a big neck (probably fine up to about 16.5 inches, then starts to be a little choker like).
759582a3-e186-44d4-ad23-02962da21635	3	I was expecting to be bigger mold.
8bf4c82b-7839-4e67-a5eb-7ac47c6393ea	5	My order came pretty fast with everything in the package. I thought I was only getting 4 in a pack, but it had several and was pleasantly surprise. I can't wait to use them for a party this weekend with my new snow cone machine.
fc3d3772-29ab-46eb-9c52-937472842dcd	2	I really like it however the beads came off after 1 day of wearing it :(
54f00426-6464-4411-8ceb-885170ab7f18	5	Awesome
d00cded1-2b8e-4bea-9e21-871d98e59750	5	I didn't even realize it locks. Smoothest can opener I've ever owned.
073cbf68-99c0-4c8c-b9f4-d71cf235a145	4	Nice quality, the size is too small for most uses.Good for carrying a notebook or papers.
b145dd83-3d4e-470d-b858-9bbed5a4312c	5	These were very solid and pretty, especially considering the great price!
0a5b020c-b39f-4dc9-a6af-babaa52050ff	3	I like the rings and they arrived on time. However, the bottom gem is loose like it isn't glued in. It hasn't fallen out, but when I touch it, the gem moves inside the metal ring. I'm not sure if all of them are like this, I have only wore one of them. If the gem doesn't end up falling out, then besides that- I have no complaints.
c1162993-0b8a-4a65-898e-51fb32095ade	5	This was perfect for cupcake toppers for a Princess birthday party.  Everyone ate the pink crowns before they started on the cupcakes.  Easy to use and clean.
7c99d270-2fbe-43d1-bd5a-984c2cf1dcff	4	I wanted this for my necklaces with fine chains that get tangled in the jewelry box no matter how careful you are.  My necklaces are mostly 18&#34; in length.  This stand is a little short for these. I am making it work but some almost drag in the tray.  Great for the money.
e262520e-b7f1-4b3c-b0a1-5edb74436bcf	5	Beautiful...daughter loved the necklace.  Would purchase again.
8f4864ae-16b5-48c2-a1fe-b9eb45356185	1	this is a piece of sh**.  It arrived dirty and broken.
69a18d6b-1085-4a5d-b54b-d00c9832b14b	5	Absolutely Love these earrings! They are super cute and unique. They look like real gold. They come in s very nice box too!
d1d99dd7-4832-473d-b0ae-75eb8e7a7dc8	4	It doesn't quick look like the picture.  There are no stones, as it looks like in the photo.  It is very nice however and I am pleased with it for the price.
f774b965-56f7-4bcc-84f0-82e90a2fb0e0	5	This knife rack looks awesome on hung on the wall. The magnets are strong and hold the knives shown in the picture securely. There is a template included for securing the rack to the  wall as well. The only thing I should mention is that it is best to pull a knife down to slide it off of the rack as opposed to pulling it away from the rack, the way it is secured to the wall allows the rack to lift off of the wall a little if you pull away, I'd think over time doing this would wear away the holes that it hangs from.
7e0814b4-db64-49db-a25f-3444313026d3	5	Love the turquoise because of all the blue in it fits nice thanks again
1c548a9e-4336-4fe4-87a3-e41c934045b9	5	This is a great grinder.  As good if not better than the ones that cost twice as much.
d268debf-e394-4ecf-a424-b3426816b73e	4	Minimalist design, strong wire, and good secure clamping power for bags of potato chips and similar.  I purchased these to use on bags of wood chips for the BBQ, and they work just fine.  For bag clips I prefer the traditional ones with greater width to them--in fact the only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't have that extra width to them--but these work just fine, have a stronger spring tension, and frankly are going to last a lot longer.
f0485faf-6f63-4440-a89d-f820917253f1	5	This was a birthday gift which has been very well received by my mother.  I do not have further details but she says that it fits well and she will be able to wear it with a range of necklines.
6d0b86d3-b31e-4464-a7d0-56be6795b451	5	lovely smaller glass pitchers. well made and thick glass. not thin., covers fit and have a pour and no pour positioning. so glad they are square to fit in the refer better. perfect for families whos members have different tastes in drinks. lids come in different colors. will buy this brand again in different sizes. great quality.

363b50f7-03f8-456c-a6ef-770a3d04f4fb	5	Love this stone!  It is bigger than my first one and fits all the pizzas I have bought or made from scratch!
cb55e7d9-9c72-4e73-ae79-9b424a30735e	5	The turtle are a perfect size, and it fits great. Its super cute and I love it. No hassle shipping and worth the price.

e300f3b3-8b79-45e5-8984-b7964eb97f2c	5	I've tried many shrimp deveiners.  Forget the gimmics.<br /><br />You don't need scissors for shrimp.  You probably don't even have time for using scissors on shrimp.  Shrimp are small.  You need it deveined and peeled in 5 seconds because you have 50-100 more to do.  And stay away from serrated deveiners - they will tear up your shrimp, not cut the shells.  This simple, indestructible tool is absolutely the best deveiner, and one of the best gifts my mom ever gave me.<br /><br />It is true that the finish will immediately wear off in the dishwasher.  Wash it three cycles before you use it.  That is my plan.  I just ordered three of them.  I accidentally left my old one at the inlaws' house, so I bought a piece of garbage locally last weekend right before a dinner party because they didn't have this model in the upscale kitchen store I went to. (dinner was late).<br /><br />I can't stress enough how perfectly simple this thing is.  Others have commented that it will tear up smaller shrimp.  That is a possibility - it depends on the user.  You are buying a hand tool.  You have to learn to use it.  The finesse is in your fingers.  Just trust me, this is the best shrimp deveiner ever.  EVER.<br /><br />[By the way, it is made by Ecko, and the seller should state that.  Other listings for the same deveiner come with a heavy $18 for shipping.  No thanks!]
a1f49ee8-fb39-4f7f-8aec-ae1e6dae2075	5	I love the cross!
00f78ed1-4ffc-4dca-b455-b6ec16316c9b	5	These are so cute I love them so much.

e8de845e-8096-4b72-9540-7ed17a4893d9	3	Works fine, but I've blown two out by trying to make a second cup too soon.
fc88573b-15c7-4a69-bc18-6f4ebd378a59	1	These were absolutely a waste of money, the molding they sent for the inside was worthless to small and inferior quality.  If there was an option for no stars I would have used it. I bought a silver set from another manufacture &#34;Big Dawgs Grills&#34;, and they were perfect l, mold was correct and a far better product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THEY ARE NOT usable.
117ee5a6-4322-4831-b65b-1934aed5d84e	5	Great
e9888f30-5f32-4e88-90aa-40cdc8573f78	5	Product arrived on time, great price and just as described.

0548535b-647b-4c66-bc37-4ccba97ab9f9	5	Choice. Super flexible & durable. And the colors are hella perfect, even better than the pic
e3d5e6fb-916a-4643-a535-26307342ea00	5	Everything I hoped for and more...and at an amazing price!  I love it and wear it everyday.

e10548dc-9cd2-42ff-a920-df356f811703	5	Awesome lunch box. I use it pretty frequently. Used to carry lunch in pyrex every day and it was so heavy. Now I only bring pyrex if I am planning on microwaving something. This bento box also keeps my food neatly separated, because who wants their foods getting all touchy feely, that's just gross.
44146a3b-e1b3-49bf-a164-ee8128e83bad	5	Who will tell me if this pan can be used on Gas Cooker or Induction cooker or both??<br />Thanks!
fdb73f2c-5895-46f9-af08-29ff529ef2cd	5	Work great.
496f25f0-ab7b-4293-b1ab-ecb7d5062e53	3	After wearing it for two weeks metal started to turn copperish color, but for the price it was fine.
500d42bc-4f6b-4147-92f4-bb62a8704634	5	Very pretty. Was a gift.
a52f133f-baee-4086-9ecd-154efaa53191	5	I love the tools it comes with. This bad boy is powerful. Even on the first setting. Sometimes I have to lift it up a couple times so it doesn't go out of control and flour gets everywhere. Once it mixes it does mix it very well. I haven't had the chance to make dough yet. So hopefully it will turn out great. I used it twice to mix the meringue to make macarons. It works well.
e959a959-699d-4c19-a9f1-95b46b653ce6	4	This is a great pendant on a strong and pretty chain!
2411d934-9c7c-4329-a385-3d7dd91ee49e	2	came out too big.
cadba32e-0e93-40e0-acf1-7b2fba0d3edc	5	I love my new Cuisinart crock pot. My old one was starting to burn my chicken, even after being on low for only a couple hours, so I had to invest in a new one. I was pleased with the price of this Cuisinart. I have long trusted the name and was glad i found it. The size is perfect for my small meals. I was once told you should fill a crock pot at least 1/3 the way to maximize efficiency. This works just great! I love that is programmable. High, low, simmer and warm. I learned the first time around low is more like a high, if you are doing the &#34;drop and cook&#34; method, of more then 6 hours, i would use simmer and put it on 7 hours. I tend to leave the house around 7, and dont get back for 9 hours later. The meats are always cook to protection. I have been very pleased too with the ease of cleaning the pot. Overall this will be my go to for all crockpot meals.
c8705e7f-2ed1-40c0-ad2a-df121b42073d	5	it is so dainty and beautiful in every detail I love it and wear it all the time
76748390-31bc-4c3e-aafc-fe28cf5ac313	5	Had to get my hubby a slimmer ring and he loved it.
aab5f389-94c5-4541-bb41-bff749a462b5	5	Love! I have a frenchie and this is an adorable and quirky key chain just like frenchie a are.
32266950-0f5b-4ddf-bcf3-9650d893a052	5	I love this pitcher!  I make a lot of decaf iced tea in the summer and this pitcher is perfect.  It seals completely.  Yes, you can lay it down on its side.  The color isn't as bright as the picture but its great.  Love the screw top, it feels very secure and is easy to pour.  I would buy it again!
af472065-bd76-41bd-b9ba-cacf2c22a401	5	I bought one necklace for my daughter and another for myself.  We both love this necklace. Beautiful design and great quality.  I will definitely recommend this necklace!!!
4d7c760f-ee93-4f73-b985-53863fe362b6	5	I love this Thermos!!  I have a mug made by Thermos and I Love it.  Things things keep liquids hot and cold so long it is unbelievable.  Great Product!

07e696c1-a2df-4b5c-9e49-2d386792db63	4	Really cute earrings, though not quite as long as I was expecting.
721c0391-de37-4ddd-85bb-073f6ee3afdf	2	Got this for Fianc&eacute;e to wear until his actual wedding ring is resized.<br />It is very poor quality, splurge and get something that will actually last.<br />With in first day of wear it was Covered in scratches. Didn't want to waste my yime on a return that was under 3 bucks.
7450831d-f4ff-4317-9cba-70160317f9a2	5	This is a nice pendant, well made, and even prettier than I had thought it would be. It arrived a lot faster than the expected delivery date.
7543b930-5f54-40a2-9e5f-2b9ae51ebc00	5	The pendant more than meets what we expected. We are completely satisfied
f2bbcbc6-3ca4-44ca-b020-8357629d4d2a	3	the cup needs a handle
c4ee0c95-b0d3-4c8b-889e-54711e95ef9a	5	Great!
db41fb76-81d0-4236-aeee-40d13416649e	5	I love my new necklace and I received it GIFT WRAPPED (without asking) one day earlier than anticipated.  Highly recommend Puppy Love.
838e9d18-e46b-44b1-afff-acd83cfa731c	5	product is great -- I use it all the time
b502df7d-25f3-4b35-9c85-24b4a52f62fc	5	Excellent!
1817d5d3-79e7-4ce2-a7fb-b8dfbeaf7402	5	perfect for not only freezing herbs and herb butters, I plan to use them for freezing my extra eggs for winter baking!
95a147b7-a527-49a6-a79d-45a31c0806a1	5	I love my dinner wear set. The color is prettier in person. For that matter the dishes are prettier in person. Very happy with this purchase!
85d528f6-2dc3-4caa-a701-6a49dece983e	1	Not a zisha clay pot.  Just a scam.  This pot will never absorb aroma.  There is no porousness.  Works well as an ash tray, albeit a tad expensive.<br />Real clay teapots are very expensive.
781d378f-c74d-4b18-b555-6c3ac3c103d0	1	Make sure you check the dimensions. These are so small. There like toy size.
80cb9994-5da7-48fc-83a8-6a8a94c7ac46	4	I love this Capresso milk frother.<br />I bought it because I heard it works great with soy milk. Boy it does the job very well so pleased with this purchase.<br />I bought the Breville milk frother first and returned it bc did not work for soy milk.<br />I'm sure it works just as well on regular milk I have not tried that yet.<br />I recommend the Capresso it works very well & heats up fast.
c89946ae-7f6d-4780-b9ee-8239fdc613d4	3	Tree pendant fell off within two weeks of wearing it.
77f32aaa-2748-46b3-9e61-7c5c91282014	5	I love this necklace. I have have turquoise with silver feather rings and earrings that look great with this piece. I have a football player like 18&#34; neck and this still hangs low on me. This measures 28&#34; on the top feather and drops the other two feathers 2&#34; down. That equals 71cm and drops the other two feathers 5cm.
492980ba-40e0-4a8a-9c5d-0919c714c403	4	I like everything about this cup. From the color to the material used and to the size
bfb9bcd8-f722-47fd-9ab2-064b2e91a5f4	5	This was a gift for my sister to use when making bath products.  It does what I needed it to do.  They act as inexpensive molds for the bath products
2424385f-42c3-4e91-b5c3-b02c97bcc455	4	This pantry rack provides great storage. The baskets are plenty big and you can hold quite a bit of stuff on the door. The downside is exactly like others are saying, it bounces upon opening and closing and stuff can fall off the shelves. Some command hooks fixed this problem without having to drill holes in my door. Overall, I really like it!
2eb2988f-452b-483a-8d0d-078acd6ed4f5	5	Great veggie brush!
dccb5873-de9e-4f8b-bb39-a130e52c2d84	5	It was part of an anniversary gift.
7b80c41c-97de-4e56-9cb7-78ab00313a71	3	Cute for the money but the post was bent on one of them upon arrival.  Bent it back and it is ok.  Very thin post.
0b6e77da-fe55-4518-9779-aceb64e16acc	1	The square and compass are not centered. Kind of important being that they represent tools of accuracy. Not sure if it's worth the trouble to return.
3d81dafc-fe8f-498c-82eb-ebc3bab37314	3	I've had this mug for two years now and only recently did it start to leak. Also, the metal taste is starting to come out in my morning coffee, definitely looking for a new one.
c027e9fa-a0a9-477f-a427-c829e4e493c6	4	Pretty.  Nice jar.  The only complaint is the latch is very cheep and may not last long if used a lot.
46053454-22ed-4c16-982d-1bc3ee05ee9a	3	Don't expect anything fabulous. That said, they are not bad and certainly do not look cheap. They have a classy, well-finished look. Be reminded that these are quite small so won't work for a big face or long hair. It is a good gift for a teenager or a grown up who has a small face with short hair. Oh, and just for the record, don't get fooled by the 14k yellow gold stuff! it's mostly silver. to be precise, it is .21 grams of silver and .11 gram of gold (14k only).
13d0b400-5ba5-430e-84df-41d9052dd3af	5	Nice
13e55729-f53e-4503-b9c9-4052fc671016	5	Loved product so much, purchased another. Plan on getting three different sizes for my family to use.
461e2a16-a887-493a-b2fb-9e60155f7d42	5	Very cute. Came exactly as expected.
05a5af7d-10cf-45a8-8d20-9c9086c6f93a	5	I like that these are exactly the same ones that match the ones already in the book.
93c0a1c8-76d6-4206-a42f-02109ccdfb17	5	It was exactly as described and it had fast shipping. I could not ask for more.
6d77398e-6fee-47d5-99a4-0e075b5c52be	3	This blender works ok as long as you aren't using frozen fruit (or probably ice but I haven't tried that).  No matter when you put in the fruit the blades have trouble pulling it down.  The smoothie setting doesn't really work with frozen fruit.  Meh.
33014228-2329-48a0-8362-ac2c5d39be0d	5	Absolutely love my earrings
e8ae94b2-8270-4f7a-bdd8-909b54a7e1d2	5	The cross is beautiful. It is very hard to find a silver tone orthodox cross which makes such a statement. I purchased it for me but ended up giving it to my daughter. The speed in which I received this cross was excellent. Thank you for selling such a treasured gem.
3e698594-ffef-4f2d-8c2a-60a4d1e48ae3	1	They are awful! Big waste of money! The plastic ring that is supposed to fit around the lid to seal it falls out all the time. They leak all the time.
6e8e0088-29c6-4e96-9748-86d9573f61e0	5	Love this ring, the inscription is hard to see unless it's up close but for the price I couldn't be happier with it. The size I picked also fits as expected and perfectly l.
e6374c58-c115-4481-843e-c4a06ed49f2f	5	Love it! Daughter gets complimented on it at school
ae900eda-7f3c-4db9-97f7-caaebd912439	5	Always go with KONO.  Beautiful bracelet for men or women!
e66f2ce3-401d-41af-aae1-bc5814ed5fbf	1	very badly made - can only be used once.
db33a98a-75bc-4a2d-9e32-1494146d9c0c	5	Great buy!
712146d9-9856-4718-a96a-abae65eff2c0	5	love it
237b5556-7a4e-475c-bd78-2c0143574c74	3	Detail in picture is better than detail on the product I received.
bb441cb9-5e26-4129-87c5-7e32b0e8e356	3	Really nice earrings, however not real gold and because of that, they irritate my ears to the point of me rubbing and scratching my ears, then they begin to bleed....
3cbcd2e6-0b34-4289-b074-2f49c21d957d	5	Most beautiful ring ever.<br />I'm size 5 and this ring is 5.5 so it's not perfect, but fits just fine on my ring finger.
7a5aa74c-5f5f-41e1-a472-4b98c83e12eb	5	I love this necklace. Its a little heavy and big but its still amazing
f48c11f9-5ee4-4024-848a-a6922e56fac1	5	My family has been cooking with cast iron frying pans for 30+ years, but our pots have mostly been Calphalon.  Our Calphalon 6 Quart pot is used quite often and even though Calphalon does have a lifetime warranty, we decided to move to a cast iron setting.  Now with a cast iron grill and frying pans which we use with our gas stove, we are adding a Dutch Oven.  We will not really cook Mexican food, as we are stew and crockpot peoples.  You can cook all types of slow cooked foods in this.<br /><br />I like the fact that it is ceramic coated which makes clean up a breeze.  However, a basic cast iron product is easy to clean also.  We use plastic scrapers from Pampered Chef and they do a bang up job.<br /><br />There are little plastic clips that come with the unit so when you flip the lid over for storage you do not chip the unit.  These will fail.  Just get a large, soft cotton dishtowel to layer in between the pot and lid.  That will also help with moisture control.
f974f538-30a9-4ade-bfd8-42684f2dab32	5	Really nice heavy ring.
a94fd319-30c8-4f80-81bf-f01060e1b526	4	Very pretty ring, I have worn it now for over a year and it has held up well. I gave it 4 stars however due to it not looking quite like the picture here, the spirals are very close together.
e0d6fe24-9555-4973-b8ea-2ea473af2cec	5	Beautiful
b8427ae7-3624-4fac-9bfa-a17deafeda45	5	With our Food Saver V2244, we like to buy in bulk; strawberries and blueberries to have during the winter months, lots of fresh salmon and fish when available, steaks, chops, and a variety of nuts and seeds, all available at the drop of a hat!  These bags are great, months in the freezer with no freezer burn, and if you buy the quart size bags you can cut them down to size for small items like the berries and nuts so there isn't any need to buy the pint size bags.  Simply great for the kitchen!
7dad04bd-3829-43b2-aa1b-06ebaac1236e	5	She loved them..........
19928547-7f22-4ed0-8604-375b7e58cf8a	5	Gave this to my mom as a surprise and she was really happy! The necklace itself does not feel cheap!! Its pretty cool. The package came really quick!
9fa8ffc4-39ce-40df-a048-18fd2999097f	5	Just what I wanted
8fd596ec-666a-48df-98cc-385519074202	3	This is OK, sapphires fall out easily.
32513713-9d38-4a93-99fd-7ba92490913c	2	The ball fell out within a couple weeks. Was able to find another similar sized ball at Michael's to fit in its place, but I like the original color better.
8e1f5e36-3828-4527-8b1a-a2e47e777688	2	Not my style. Don't like the clasp and I thought they were smaller.
0179d6a4-bc4d-486c-9201-74560fc9e7cd	4	Very nice. Just exactly what I expected. Best way I know to use little dressing and get all the salad covered. Very retro to the 80's when we used wooden salad bowls at every meal.
75b83544-9707-46db-b913-3f8310f16a34	5	good
a9179fe3-2f76-4087-85b8-a3a734ff2bad	3	They stick in one place but are really hard to see very small
0f786dd9-c158-47e6-bd79-7b6c0592d085	2	This bread holder slicer thingy is okay. Had I been thinking proactively I woud have looked for one of these with either a ceramic or other sort of base that would not become scored every time one slices a bread roll. Maybe it will last 3 years, then, fall apart from being sliced by a hand sharpened bread knife. I dunno. I won't buy this product again nor would I recommend it.
2e3f3840-1f65-4c4e-95d4-02e717ab48ab	5	This charm is full of sparkle and color! So pretty! Love it!
0002d381-c52a-42a7-9734-362403d3faf5	5	I bought two for my Granddaughters and they loved them.

742d194b-8c06-41ba-b589-bd947e76542e	5	Love this Keurig, perfect for my family. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.
423062c7-037e-437b-8fbe-83b273ed61c9	2	After just one use, the left side no longer works.
ba5cc40c-3549-47f2-b660-36fbbe0bf841	5	It is wonderful not to have to scrub cooked food off the slow cooker insert.
566baf6d-2933-4d2e-bda4-23d52968e9e1	5	works well!
7f9c8778-8a7b-4b04-994b-30ec67c7e6a9	5	Love these bowls
32e1d9f6-1651-4571-981a-300f69f0401b	3	This cutting board is ok, small ok. One side has juice channels around the perimeter while the other is completely flat. The material does retain the cut marks, which I did not have with previous, similar material, cutting boards. That may not be such a bad thing as debris is not retained in the board.
0aee6b03-c0b3-433b-ae44-f51b4fc99f04	5	I love these so much I can't even explain. I just said to my hubby last night as I was cutting up my home grown basils and parsley on to our Caprese Salads, &#34;This was one of my best purchases&#34;. Loved them so much I bought myself a second pair for the RV and because my daughter-in-law saw them and went nuts she got a pair too! And YES, she loves them just as much. Now I have to get more for my other daughter-in-law who says she's doing a garden just to be able to use hers! hahahaha
2735b8b4-c8ad-4f70-b98e-e27c5b4adb81	4	Beautiful bracelet, really sparkles.  My girl loves it.
d20e6708-caaf-42c9-af63-573a901a725e	4	Nice ring for the money. Ordered size 8 fit are a little large, need 1 size smaller on 8 but not available
91d87ad0-01fa-4a7d-aaf6-85f2f305b14c	5	Used it first time and the batter does not stick.  That is the purpose of non stickðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€.  Happy and satisfied!! Would recommend to all who want to make hassle free idlies!
4804ff18-3a09-4caf-99f8-b8774c0f75d6	5	Quick delivery and beautiful stones.

5a5c3662-1217-4f6c-8910-9fcfc862bac1	5	use for toys
ae826340-52a9-4477-8aa2-7bcf16b11836	5	There aren't a lot of diverse demands I have for buckets.  This one satisfies them all.  Small, but not too small, does not have holes or leaks, has all the fancy and important words on it that need to be shown for business reasons.  It's not a luxury bucket, but then, i'm not sure what that would be.
d839a4b0-a4a8-4d76-ab15-24283d28c515	3	The dish is larger than the ones that own from the past, and very heavy
4f23f3ef-8e24-4e01-a263-a3f17a460ace	5	great quality
19bf96e0-6886-4138-b5f9-45b627e79499	5	Very strong magnet.  Took about  5 minutes to install.  Fits about 6 knives.  Perfect!

bf2a6e1f-b854-471f-bf55-922318b87388	4	I am a pastry chef by trade. These special design rolling pins are very handy to add to your design arsenal. It is a quick way to add design flare.<br /><br />What You Get: (1) FOUR-C Rolling Pin &#34;Labyrinth Textured&#34; design, Color: Clear (6.3&#34; inches length X 0.5&#34; inches width x 11.91mm thickness, weight: 0.6 ounces).<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />âž” This design is an interesting textural design element, it reminds me of the stacks of dumbbell weights, from a profile perspective, joined together.  Could also work for native peoples themed designs as well (see cons). Great for cookies or molding chocolate.<br /><br />âž” Instant Parkay Design. Roll your fondant, or pastry flat, then use this pin to imprint an parkay type textured pattern, wherever you roll it.<br /><br />âž” Modified PMMA (Poly(methyl methacrylate)). An economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when extreme strength is not necessary. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits (BPA) found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when loaded, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA can achieve high scratch and impact resistance.<br /><br />âž” Easy to clean - run under warm water with dish detergent. Hand wash only.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />âž” Not heat or dishwasher safe.<br /><br />âž” I would be sensitive to what clients this rolling pin is used for. I just realized looking at it,there is a certain symbol that appears at each of the design joints all over the design, which has very negative connotations to a certain people. Native peoples however,have used this same symbol for millennia as a symbol of peace or prosperity.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Interesting textural element for random or native people themed parties. Uses are endless, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.ss, as is your creativity.<br /><br />** I received the FOUR-C Rolling Pin Labyrinth Textured Cupcake Decorating Tools, Color: Clear, Sold by MEIJIA MEILIN, in exchange for providing honest feedback - All views expressed here are of my own and not influenced as a result.
bc82ae8d-afff-4680-8a6a-64d76a6c6159	5	I love the design and water quality!
9ebb03b9-a0bd-428c-b383-22aa5e6cb0c9	4	First one was rusty, replaced it for cleaner one. Liked it:)
5333d39a-8981-4cae-be7b-1a4d21836f7a	5	These earrings are great. I have multiple ear piercings and am always buying studs that vary in size, so that i can have them go from big to small or vice versa. I also like these because I feel like the smaller sizes are good to wear second and third  ear piercings without seeming to big or awkward. I also really like how these earrings are packaged as the three smaller sizes come together on one card while the three larger ones come on a separate card.   If you only have one or two piercings I think the bigger sizes would be great for everyday use and if you are like me with multiple ear piercings I feel you will get a lot of use out of this set being able to mix and match the various earrings sizes. Overall I feel that these are perfect for everyday wear.  I did receive this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.
e1cad440-64a2-4e8b-9fbb-688cec6de659	5	Wonderful addition to my wife's collection.  She first introduced me to the Claddagh ring when she got back from a trip to Ireland. We were engaged a short time later and married within a year.  I love to buy her items with the design and I am very excited that we found this to add to her Troll Beads bracelet.  Looking forward to seeing her face.
2c534c07-03a7-4e79-aa94-bea04ca28d1d	5	Beautiful...just the right size
e404f4d1-b2d3-45a0-b236-f3e09d61baee	5	Beautiful.  This ring is exactly as pictured.
3981253e-9ddc-4fd5-a858-3164e1e8a335	5	Works exactly like it's supposed to.
15010421-e8d6-48a3-b491-b19899962dbe	1	Nice corkscrew mechanism.  I bought it because it was listed as heavy duty.  Unfortunately, the cheap plastic insert that meets the top of the bottle neck shattered on the second of bottle wine I opened.  So now I have a heavy duty piece of metal that doesn't function.  Oh well, it went to the recycling bin.
b51649ea-6344-4448-ae2a-1d15b4e9d592	5	Good items, means that I can use my Keurig coffee machine for many other coffees and teas etc.
bd8893dc-5a56-4ea8-a58b-959407b7dba1	5	Great product
3e1e8828-a7e5-42b1-baa9-e41ef3cc9e35	5	I bought it on August 4, and it arrived on the 7th. Not only is that fantastic shipping time, it is really worth buying. I got it for my girlfriend because her birthday is today so I wanted something nice to give her. Great job D-Gold. It's a really nice necklace.
f7fea5e1-e353-48d0-b758-0476cd3e46f7	5	My chalice of shame will go down in history as the most shameful chalice.
4e65c2c9-f721-4a75-978f-df3044ff9079	5	Looks great, perfect size for a party, fast delivery!  No spigot issues--works perfectly.
8ab0a216-f845-4960-810c-0ffa74cd5466	5	So far I love these knives. They are very sharp and I love the sheaths.
bff3fa3d-e90f-4be3-8070-977290b68c1f	4	These are nice earrings but didn't have the dimension for the actual tube -- were a little thinner than I thought the proportions seemed in the photo.  It is workable earring set and look fine, but the closure requires that you pay attention to be sure it is closed -- it does close securely.
b7402bbd-fb11-4ec1-9b78-d8ff05b12da9	2	One of the earrings broke the first time I put it on.
94e62c51-70ac-4609-ac4f-3be6b4beb4d4	5	These are sweet!!!<br />-<br />I am like the only guy in America who wears cufflinks every day to work.  I'm not an old man (yet) and I'm not some schmaltzy lawyer.  I'm a regular guy working a desk job.  But why not dress up?  It doesn't hurt anyone.  And guys have limited options when it comes to jewelry, so cufflinks are like the only way to express yourself.<br />-<br />And what better way than with these Star Trek cufflinks!?  They look really cool!  Unleash that inner nerd you've been trying to hide with these super-cool white starfleet cufflinks!  They rock!<br />-<br />This review was provided in exchange for a free/discounted version of the product.
c4069d29-ee43-4b42-bfa8-5566dacd327c	1	horrible product support from the company-- had it only only month and it just quit working  one day after working earlier in the am.  Because I was honest and told them I had experienced one power outage in that month, even though it worked AFTER the power outage, Latoya and her supervisor at Mr. Coffee service center said that their product failure was &#34;an act of God&#34; and that they would not cover a replacement.<br />They suggested that I should unplug  it after every use, even though this model comes with a delayed brewing button and clock to set up for the next morning!<br />I have been using a Mr Coffee since the 70's when Joe DiMaggio advertised for them, but with their condescending customer service they have lost a customer for life and I would advise no one else purchase from this company
fcf8b024-1106-44e9-a59b-5b58c2096c69	1	Very pretty & bright. Don't have my bracelet yet but I think it will be really pretty in it. 5/2016 All of the Charms I bought from Everbling should be sold as disposable they r so disappointing because u just fall in love with them then their stones fall out & they become dark & nasty. I could have brought more than a bracelet full when I 1st received them. I am so glad I waited I will never buy any more.
c9200d45-70b7-4c41-8d20-7669a2d408f9	5	this is the best cup of coffee that I have made at home , ever.  love the pull out basket and rotating base.  I have my pot set on bold strength and it is perfect.  this pot replaced one that was one month old (hate it).
2fc7f1c5-383f-4a88-9198-7122062876d0	5	Perfect size. I had originally bought the &#34;United Solutions SB0121 Set of Three Large Plastic Nesting/Stacking Storage Bins in Black-3 Rough and Rugged Black Bins&#34; to put things like tomatoes, apples and other veggies and fruits in them. But they ended up being too big. So I bought this and it's the perfect size. It sits great on my counter and you can reach into the bottom basket to get things, without hitting the top of your hand on the second basket. Very pretty and doesn't look cheaply made either. Would recommend it.
79acd531-34d9-4b21-9d41-212b2db873cf	5	very pretty!
203ebfea-d1ba-4485-ac7e-ced71f181b7e	5	best earrings i have bought in a long time! very excellent quality and i am getting asked where i found them.  good job and i love the price.
30efe693-bc50-4849-b1d9-9deacc362faa	5	item as described and delivered quickly
5474aaf1-e09e-4525-9dad-73fb07f73e8a	5	the best
34e83287-922b-400a-ad12-7afef843e832	5	Gave this item as a gift and she loved it! Has been using it daily :)
daf1003c-206d-42d4-912f-9c83b1a48f2f	5	This is a nice ring, howver, I found out after I bought it that Chrome Diopside is a soft stone and you should handle with care. I wore this to a conference (3-day) recently and it was nice and didn't interfere with using the computer. It is small, but it has a lot of sparkle. Was packaged nicely and arrived on time.
ca605337-32be-4a70-a849-17809d038100	1	Very disappointed.  So tiny.  Looks much better on the Amazon site and should stay there.
94bbd12d-1669-43fd-a79f-b30e5ac36a61	3	quality is not great
087c98af-f9fb-4fb1-9840-9ac4944cc30b	5	For ladies into &#34;Boho&#34; this necklace is the best.  I will be wearing it a bunch!
5f565f02-7657-4f91-bfe6-cc8855c9f847	5	Matches the set I have could not ask for better
4574c9db-2668-48cf-9cdd-7bcd9ec8a60c	4	So far very nice was as expected. I wish the picture could be a little bit bigger.
51d527f7-0b06-422b-89eb-3c254b077666	4	I would love it if the tube were silicone.
52ec54b2-8380-409f-9e0b-62fc819fc4a4	5	I got these as a gift for my daughter.  She wears them nearly every day.  Good value, well made, and nice looking.
f08f4761-5ee0-41f7-a265-1942b3073587	5	they were smaller then expected, but still beautiful and look great in my daughters ears.
148f8054-0a5a-46c6-bfb7-3dc3d6c4a8b8	5	I purchased this for a dear friend and she loved it! Thanks for creating such a meaningful way to let someone know that the relationship between a father and daughter is very special!
423e85b8-a5d1-4398-97ba-65f3fca380f5	5	Love these earrings true to size and picture as advertise would buy again.
2475e851-99d5-45df-83f5-ab7c1cc8ea0e	5	Great addition to dry more foods at the same time
ccaab34d-e935-4a33-8217-f9cabb7e4e7e	2	I've had these for a few months now and have never worn them. I should have listened to the other reviewers. These look cheap, and they have the yellow cast noted by others. While they will pick up some other colors depending on your clothing, the insipid lemon undertone remains. I also bought the matching necklace, which looks even more cheap than the earrings. It gets 2 stars because gave my 9-year-old loves them for playing dress-up.
1fc9e893-ba92-4202-b21e-22043f44b05b	5	In one wordâ€¦AMAZING! I was so excited to get my hands on these kitchen scissors that I intentionally went shopping for things I could cut. I have a limited amount of time to cook, so I am always looking for a great gadget that will make the prepping process faster and more fun for me in the kitchen.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the look, feel, and ability of these kitchen scissors.<br /><br />Besides the sleek and sophisticated look, they actually work!<br />These scissors are sturdy, lightweight, and easy to use with just one hand. I did not struggle to hold or operate them. I love that there is a convenient safety lock to hold the sharp blades together when not in use, so I don't have to worry about hands and fingers getting into harm's way.<br /><br />I was especially excited to see how these scissors stood up to the challenge of cutting meat and veggies, rather than just herbs like those I have used in the past. I was able to cut carrots, green onions, and cucumbers just for fun, but I was most impressed with how easily the blades glided through the layers of my rotisserie chicken. I received a discount to purchase these scissors, and they are certainly my new go-to kitchen buddy!<br />I canâ€™t wait to see what else they can do.
6f662fa8-14c7-4c6b-9704-c19a8d3c9f9f	5	Fantastic - love the recipes you get as well.
074ed296-e1f6-4182-8b24-a6c7c061d617	2	Sadly it broke the first time I used it. It dropped it, caught it and suddenly the display doesn't show temperature anymore.
3d1618bf-3c4e-4383-86b3-1a8d3b77ee3f	5	Fun and versitile
898ef8ed-555c-4aeb-aa58-adf1fee57d7f	5	Love this thermometer it is very accurate & love how it is digital.
d99965b6-1639-46d8-9cde-0685acc3ecd2	5	These are beautiful
2b040a47-01a9-4a25-a71b-f859cc950521	5	I enjoy using cooktop for cooking. Easy to control temp. Saves on electric bill and does not heat up kitchen. I like the way it heats cast iron skillet, that I use.
d7a69cb9-89a5-4132-b091-82a6028285de	5	Nice size and has a temperature knob.
1c4e1d81-c470-44be-9ef8-35ed32f44ec7	2	She loved the stuff but the necklace is a bit thin and broke to easily
ee3fe3c4-d7b4-4066-b8f8-5a500da17ff4	5	I loved it!
6198ff4f-ee0d-40e2-8baf-bfbc7e629bdc	5	GREAT PRODUCT,FAST SHIPPING
d3824977-79aa-4599-8a90-6be4b2470436	5	Worked well at my picnic. I was so glad I bought them. We had such a fly problem around the food table that I honestly don't know what we would have done w/o them.  I like how little space they take up for storage. Just sprayed them off in my tub let them dry and put away for next time. Going to order more.
70517fb6-5f21-4a0e-81a3-ec113de8e178	1	Horrible!!! The gem scratched the top of my mouth and was not anything like the picture
df68482d-3e7d-47fb-9d1f-8623dfde6de0	5	God had made this necklace such an luckily charm in my life. Thank you so much for making this product! I loved it!!
6e537c43-5ce6-4fcc-aa5b-deb29a977df7	5	Great feel - great taste expansion!
c402a82b-3981-4670-b317-a62c4846076e	3	Its ok; very flat finish; basically unfinished.  Classic case of &#34;You get what you pay for!&#34;
89dad089-5bd1-4030-8e0e-a4fe84456e70	5	Absolutely beautiful and perfect for my silver pendants
eb4a435d-a3b8-4a22-a1cf-e39a6f31830e	5	My new favorite.  Gorgeous detail without looking too flashy.
fc0e9586-4bf5-4901-9370-778ed685a484	4	This is a cool ring. Well worth the $12 I paid for it.
f1693c70-bac5-40e3-b15d-3ed82bdf8c36	5	Was gift. Got goid response back.
69ed91a7-b1e4-44e9-932e-9b61d82af558	5	It's a measuring cup - Pyrex is a good brand.  Not too much to write about a measuring cup.
c73ef05a-9ee3-4139-afce-4b7a7e9b16d3	2	Can't wear it around my neck, sharp edges.
0e78f11f-4b6d-48da-8f05-1ef47708082b	5	BEAUTIFUL
f0f7fa6b-6515-4e62-b5e2-f59a522d8e15	5	It fits my oversized loaves perfectly!
6552a5af-571e-416d-93dc-06b277bbb750	5	I just received these in the mail today, which was extremely fast :-) They are stunning, amazing color and perfect size. I will say that the backings are not substantial enough to hold the earring in securely, but that is an easy fix with different backings. I most definitely would recommend these to anyone.

3b1a1545-a350-4a12-a9dd-d79eed0909bc	5	my previous labrets would get caught on my teeth, because the stems were too long. This one is perfect, I never take it out. The color is lighter than it appears online which for me, is better. Nice item!
fce3f5f5-9db3-4abf-91d8-6756447c1eac	5	Whoa! This knife came just about ready to use. I honed each side of the edge to remove the bur, then it was sharp and ready to go. First use was on a tri-tip. One pull through 3 inches of beef with very little pressure. No need to saw at your meat with this knife. Gives you clean cuts without damaging the meat.
594f9cb0-cd94-4d28-bd3e-8009eb625517	4	Although this bag does a better job than the almond milk bag I purchased, it still does leave a small amount of fine coffee grounds in the bottom of my jar.  If I use coarsely ground coffee beans, the brew is not strong enough for me but the finer the grind the more residue it leaves.  I was also using this with a quart size mason jar; however, it was very difficult to get the bag full of soaked grounds out of the jar.  I have since ordered a glass pitcher with a wider mouth, a spout and an air tight cap which works much better for the shape of this bag.

59a531da-e6b7-49a0-8fbf-3a538846a87f	5	A really great quality stainless steel garlic press. Once you get your package you will instalty know it's heavy quality stainless steel material. It comes with a extra silicone peeler to remove the skin from the garlic.  You can add about 2 or more garlic depending on the size. You can get the job of chopping up garlic easy and fast. I usually cut it up and store some in a tight glass container for later use. This garlic pressed is easy to use. And easy to clean. Can be washed in dishwasher.  It is durable, convenient and a nice kitchen addition. It has a beautiful design and I can get a great grip. Feels good in my hand I can feel the job getting done easy and fast. Doesn't rust. Check this product and give it a try.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own real honest opinion about the product.

12169dcb-046d-441f-8b1d-01c1dfd7c399	5	This sterling silver and simulated diamond ring was a gift for a friend to say, we're friends for eternity as this ring features the eternity design with 2 strands looping together. Someone had told us once in a reading we did for fun, that we're like two braids woven together joined by our karmic destinies. Though we took it lightly, it meant something, and this ring seemed like the perfect way to say I remember...my friend loved it.<br /><br />This ring has tiny diamonds set into the braids weaving in and out and shine and sparkle. The ring is very well made and great enough for every day wear. Since it marked something special my friend wanted to wear it on special occasions as it can catch dirt due to it's design.<br /><br />This ring was perfect for a gift as it came in a beautiful and heavy black ring box in a leather like finish with a gold embossed pattern. There was a white outer cardboard box to protect the ring box on the inside.<br />[Received free or discounted product to test for a candid review]
b6d30ddb-76ba-4396-b870-b8a5b3a814f1	3	Very pretty and appeared to be well made. I love the look of pierced nipples but not the whole.... everything else so I thought these would be perfect. &#34;Would be perfect&#34; if they fit, but alas, they did not. I didn't think my nipples were on the small size, I guess I should have paid more attention. I even bent the sides of the loop (squished in) and they stayed on... until I moved. So if your nipple is less than the 10 cm wide, I'd pass.
adf20f97-a112-4d77-9686-acfd7a1f1060	5	I was pleasantly surprised by these earrings. Got here faster than the estimated date. The quality is really good. The picture is clearer than I expected can defiantly see every detail. I have no complaints what so ever.

6d16bb67-ddb9-49bb-8b05-385b45578653	2	Zipper broke within a month. :-( The freezer part was perfect and the size of the bag was awesome. I think this was a knock off and not a true packit bag unfortunately. If the zipper would have held up I would have given it a 5 but without the zipper the bag is useless.
ceb948da-5411-4585-b7e9-1615cf1aba53	1	Not happy with the quality of this item.  They were cute but not worth the money. I even had to pay shipping to return the items.
e9cc3284-eb97-454c-afb1-3505061053a9	2	Looks fancy, feels lightweight. I read the reviews and they're all right so I only use these when I'm taking pictures of my food. My parents have tried to microwave them and they warped, hence the 3 stars. Also, they're so light don't put anything heavy on top because they will crack.<br /><br />I tossed 2 that cracked in the microwave and will not repurchase these again.
4ceabe5f-6a72-40bd-afee-388a764bbf15	1	If icould my rating would be 0 stars,when I received bracelet,opened package and out came bracelet and broken clasp,contacted INBLUE,rep.explained how clasp was already broken when I opened package,i was instructed to take photograph,submit picture of bracelet and clasp to inblue and as he said at that time they will discuss compensation.I never had a chance to wear bracelet,based on INBLUES unreasonable time consuming spin for compensation,all which cost $13.00 + shipping it was easier for me to take the loss and in the future never to purchase any products by INBLUE!
a1dcf4a8-04f5-4839-a573-f5689b8d8ef2	1	Very upset. The one they sent me had a different top and it's very cheap looking and ugly.
d7aa31f3-56a9-4a9f-85f5-e4b0e07d78da	2	The coffee maker makes excellent coffee and the design that lets you swing out the works to fill with water and coffee grounds without pulling it from under the counter is a great feature but the poor functioning glass carafe ruins the joy. I just can't pour water into the unit without a deluge on the counter no mater what position or speed I try and  I now take my cup to the sink to pour my coffee to catch the excessive dribble.<br />  I have contacted De Longhi CUSTOMER SERVICE to see if they have a solution and I am waiting for their reply. The problem (as I see it) is the carafe has a plastic lip completely around the top and it disrupts the flow from the spout.<br />  In the meantime I have been using the glass carafe from my De Longhi DC76T 12 cup coffee maker which is all glass (except for the lid and it works well. I purchased the DCF6214T to replace the damaged DC76T and thankfully I hadn't discarded the old unit yet.<br />  I would hope De Longhi will see the problem and have a &#34;Recall/Replacement&#34; program for the current Glass Carafe's.

94355785-9280-4536-a172-9ae768fe1b35	2	Product is true to the picture and arrived on time so 2 stars. However there are a lot of craftsmanship issues because when I bought and wore it, the jump ring connecting the glass galaxy piece and moon piece seemed to be loose or had a gap because I wore it for a few hours and the glass piece fell off. I ended up having to put it back together with a pair of tweezers. Quality was not up to standard, would not recommend.

ba5ac8f8-fe37-492d-85c7-79172d4418c3	5	Funny but I have never been a red person, but after bringing home my mother's kitchen table from the 1950's and the retro red chairs I bought her several years back I decided I needed a few more red accents in the kitchen so I purchased this coffee pot. It is a simple coffee pot which is all my husband needs for his few cups in the morning, we did not need a timer so this fit the bill perfectly. No issues with this product, worth the money,
6ed3efa1-fc98-4f08-8b6d-e2d2a683629e	3	Work well the first few times but they don't last very long. This is one of those items you get what you pay for.

Like so many others mentioned,  the seam towards the bottom is a problem. Mine started leaking in a couple different places at the same time. So dissapointed I am forced to buy another so soon.

7f894934-9fed-47dd-813a-af31ddc56573	5	I am loving these lids.  They are great to have around.  They do take a little extra practice to learn how to use, so don't try them the first time on a multi batch canning day, load the canner with your 7 jars, and see how they do when you follow the instructions.  The lid has to be secured just right.  I usually apply more pressure to these than I do when I can with the metal jars, but practice makes perfect.  I have found a superior seal with these.  These can be difficult to open, but to me they are well worth it.  I don't have to run to the store to buy more lids, or worry about getting things in advance.  I know how many jars I need for the year, and that is how many lids I have.  Great product.

a79229e6-189d-460b-99b8-b5491040892b	5	This is an exact copy of a Joan Boyce ring that I own except hers has a pearl in the middle. And hers wasn't $10, even at a reduced price. I highly recommend this ring.

d3cb06c0-c46a-42b0-8775-ac0d2055a2f7	5	This Ring Magic ring sizer/ring safety bands are different from every ring sizer I have ever used.  It is unique.  You get a pack of 3 and they are 1 size small (size 3-5), 1 size medium (size 5-9), and 1 size large (size 7-12).  You can resize your ring in no time.  It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, but once you get it figured out, it will be your favorite ring sizer.  I love that it has the ring safety feature. You never have to worry about losing your rings. It works with multiple rings and gives you a snug fit.  They are comfortable to wear.  I received these at a discount for my honest review and I must say they are awesome.  I would recommend these to anyone who wears rings.

5cc5a658-0485-48ed-957c-adff1d9b163e	1	If you have small ears do not buy this, it's sized more for a guy's ear and wont bend down enough for me to get it to fit on my ear. Also the bracelet came broken and I had to put it back together.

637af02b-9aaa-47f2-b5c2-1dc439a78dfe	4	I like these. I like the size and the thickness.  My old set had 1 for veg (green) and 1 for fruit (light yellow) and I really liked that, but I'll just have to incorparate the chicken one for fruit I guess.

698c604a-3d29-4b8b-8b6a-6046ca429a0c	4	It's larger than sized. I bought a 7 but should have ordered a 6, maybe even a 5. I bought an adjuster to fix it bc I'm not sending back anything that is less than $20.

a8e724e2-f24c-4150-a1ce-61e0674ce693	5	&#34;Nice quality bottle opener. Mounted it outside in the weather and it hasn't tarnished. Looks and works great. &#34;
e925e435-ab48-4e1f-b0ed-169c731aa592	5	Excellent. Thank you
f4ea4a31-b7bb-4643-82ef-a00b4392cd6d	5	This produces excellent coffee. Takes me only about 8 minutes in the morning and is well worth it. I no longer buy my coffee out- I save a ton of money and it tastes better. I actually don't even get grounds in the coffee. I grind it coarse with a burr grinder. I wish I had bought the 23 ounce- the 17 ounce really can only make about 14 oz which doesn't quite full my travel mug. Still, no regrets.
1129731b-6ce5-4e55-b6f9-38b5abc246d6	4	Have had my Henckels knives for 12 years, but lost my scissors.  Great scissors, not super high quality as the knives, but they work very well.
bc6e60c7-536d-4277-929f-ebe319f48dc0	5	I love this charm the picture do not show the true picture of the beauty of this charm.  I have Pandoraâ€™s charms and it is just a nice with a lesser price.  Also, it is a nice size not to small and not too big. Iâ€™m going to purchase again from this vendor. Finally, it came to my house in two days.

c8910c33-04fd-47ba-b2b9-d3f64e082f43	4	Looks good
4ce95a7c-c3a9-4779-9851-d4edf32cc05d	5	Beautiful,  bought this for gifts. Those who got them loved them.they think I spent a  lot for them.
55565561-5d52-42fe-b9a6-25dffbb65619	5	As shown in picture, very nice quality! It fits well on my bracelet. Shipped without any problems.
c31638ec-92ae-49cd-9616-5e52b38942e8	5	It's pretty good. I'm not fond of the 8-slice ones so this produces much smaller apple pieces. I did notice that it seems harder to get the initial piercing done because more blades = more resistance (sort of?). I'm not too certain what the purpose of the grey part is, but I'm assuming a blade protector. You have to swivel it out of the way to use the blades. It can't normally be removed without some tools, but overall it's a good product.
73a5d835-5581-49f8-bf71-b51ae6c08569	5	Awesome I still wear them everyday and I received them months ago. I was worried the gold would come off but it hasn't at all!
c765d7d1-040a-43ea-803a-e735731b0812	5	Fits the sink, perfectly.
a9ad5f0f-386d-4b41-b54d-24e9da82e65a	5	Sturdy handle and easy to clean. Great buy<br />Keeps the hot food hot and cold food cold.
0bfa67a7-d4c6-4815-b367-a71f89dc2288	1	WYSINWYG.  Bought it for the novelty factor and when that didn't work, it seemed like nothing more than a toy.
fa383033-ec6b-47f4-a9c9-3271364c33e2	4	As described and would purchase for this vendor again.
5eb30cb2-e284-42ee-8ea1-37d6fd4f9d9e	5	This ring is Beautiful! I love everything pink and this hits the mark. It's as pictured, perfect. I would buy again from LingMei.
a3d5494c-1cb8-4308-8a45-9618dd750401	5	Lovely ring!
71d00692-3cf5-475a-95cc-60c543a01278	5	my aunt loved it
a90f9187-3910-4dcb-b5a7-8ca1bec00a13	3	It was what I expected
68e40b73-9b39-4d1a-b5a8-ba1af51b8671	5	This was very well received by the 15 year old girl for whom it was purchased. She loved it!
ac903eb7-278b-4787-b099-290a7fa2bc79	5	I just starting keurig products and this machine is so easy to use! Brews a great cup of coffee. Thanks keurig, for the free pods for this review.
0e418462-76cd-4da0-adf0-4ce9c186adf2	5	nice
c31bdc8a-5fa2-4b53-9c69-aa3b2d8842e2	4	Not bad at all for the price, just wish I could find the entire set in real silver. Love the size of the earrings!
678c12b5-2e2e-43f5-bbfb-777b62e7f0ed	5	It's awesome so cute
cc584868-0f00-4664-85ef-fc6eeed1fcde	4	I couldn't believe my rings were that dirty.
9344c22b-2261-4e19-bf5e-fde042a45539	5	This are really cool for any occasion
8f6a6412-676a-40e1-a9a9-22c91e3e594a	4	This is a beautiful bracelet.  The carving is very detailed, a very nicely made bracelet.  Unfortunately, this is for a larger wrist.  I have to bend the bracelet to the point it overlaps and with continued use it will break, so I will not be able to wear it.
1e89dd3e-d317-4944-9323-b71a87cab34e	2	This is my fourth Krups expressed maker; the first one (and still the best) lasted 18 years making excellent espresso coffees.<br />Had high expectations with this machine but was let down. The unit looks good, appeared to be made with a fair amount of stainless steel but it is just appearance, it is mostly plastic.<br />Keeping appearance aside, the quality of the coffee is extremely erratic even utilizing some of the best ground coffee in the world; the Italian Illy brand, Lavazz, etc.<br />In automatic mode, the coffee is watery. Had to increase the brewing temperature and use only the manual mode and one out of 3 times, it get a half decent expresso.<br />Even though it has been in usage only a couple of months, thinking of replacing it.
afc81506-736a-4185-b587-320ac35de20b	1	I had the necklace only a few weeks and it broke.
6b0fc2f0-0085-4c53-8526-4a7712a92b52	5	I was very hesistant to buy my soon to be husbands wedding band off the internet. I am so glad I did. He loves it and I am thrilled with the quality of the ring.
3eee285c-3fa6-4849-8455-5fe623276650	5	Has some weight to it.  Very sturdy.  Should last a lifetime of wear.  Very pleased.
44b36080-ceaf-4a10-9fc3-a77f86544728	5	Very heavy duty !  Crystal clear
2eeee70c-6d18-4125-960b-b4f98bd5a262	5	I have purchased several toe rings, but this one HIT the mark. I looks stylish. the silver looks genuine and not silver plated. great shine factor.  doesn't feel like it will break if adjusted.
3a7bec76-88e8-4e50-b4cf-4ef4818bd83b	3	Its ok. I wished they would have a meat temp scale on the back of unit or a hang tag so that I know the correct temp for different meats
e8d814cf-2cf3-4b8e-8b9f-727c7ab0ce11	3	The ring itself is very nice, shopping took almost 2 weeks though, was quoted 5 days.
ac0d1f87-f4cd-4001-b283-379a3cececf3	5	This ring is GORGEOUS!! I immediately put it on and said, &#34;This is the prettiest ring I own.&#34; And I have very nice jewelry. I want to gift it to my loved ones! For size perspective, I wear a size 6.
fa4f1009-9c3a-4599-b026-aac1a1c2d2fd	5	It smells a bit upon arrival (it's neoprene = wetsuit material), but washes well in the washer (cold, air dry) and dries fast. Smell fades fast, especially with washing. Perfect cat-fan item. The base is black, so stains aren't a problem. Roomy and has a sturdy zipper.
399e4875-686e-4ffb-9843-57c8e251a0b2	4	Nice, sparkly zircon stones, perfect size ... not too small, not too large. Backs of earrings are sturdy. Am very satisfied  ... (just wish they were real diamonds:-))
4a4b5d9c-c62d-40e7-b094-bed7b3006536	2	It's silly to pay for this product
3264511d-003c-4735-a922-e29cfe1abaa6	5	Love these boxes for giving ring gifts.
5f2cd4ab-36e2-4155-8b72-d2975fedd4ab	5	I purchased this mat as I have been cooking a lot more lately. I got the inspiration from my boyfriend's mom who has one of these in her kitchen. Hers was larger but the &#34;cushy&#34; part of the mat is exactly the same. I love how the mat is easy to clean up if I spill something on it. It seems very durable and well made, especially for the price! I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested.
a2b599e9-25d8-4e05-a3f0-413ddb7e2841	5	This charm is adorable and a great addition to my ever growing Pandora bracelet!
d7e94c07-0295-405e-aeb6-691254965063	5	I buy ring a couple a months ago I never feel so free in my entire life and protected I never take off this ring.the one I have now Is a little small so a getting a bigger one now.
e4a29ee7-a708-46a1-9556-52197fe7bf0f	5	Good variety for the price, would recommend!
db91d131-69d9-4e39-962b-72fe966c0fae	4	I recently upgraded my Keurig Brewer from the Keurig Mini to the Keurig K250.  I love the fact that at the press of button, I have a fresh cup of coffee is 30 seconds.  However, I don't think this brewer gets my cup of joe as hot than my mini brewer did.  Also I ran into the trouble that some of the K-cups that I had for my mini did not work in the newer 2.0 system.  As a result, be careful of the K-cups that you purchase so they are compatible with the newer 2.0 systems.  Kuddos to Keurig's customer service as they were excellent in handling my questions regarding the K-cup situation.<br />OVERALL, I would say I love my new Keurig!
259cecf6-4c92-4de0-b4e9-21d23e9c83a5	2	The ones I got are more like cellophane than plastic and when you stretch them open to use them, the material tears away from the elastic, making them useless. I am so sad that I bought several packages of these. I've never had this problem with any other similar products.
6aa14a89-5e84-4b5a-818e-cbfc30f869f2	3	I like them but I broke one already.
c812635b-f2af-4afd-8662-f9cd71ea9ec0	5	Beautiful and fast shipping!
7650822f-9708-4561-8773-65f5bfcf30bc	1	This made mush of my veggies. Very disappointed
c51455e2-dfa2-464d-b16d-7fcf0dc427aa	5	This was a gift for my mom and she wears it everyday and loves it.
f008ac98-f924-41a0-8544-a8f1f66e9021	3	The tooth was not as pictured it looks totally different. I really wanted a front tooth so I could make a necklace but I think I received a back tooth. The tooth is nice so I don't feel cheated just disappointed.
834d9fca-dc27-483c-b2c1-0a217e24df72	3	They are too large! Wish they were smaller hoops! Disappointed!
6e62e4a6-fbb4-483f-acdb-88ed50d97b7d	2	The water coming out of this bottle tastes like plastic and does not give the crisp taste that a steel bottle would give.
9270c0ea-9f61-42a8-b480-3e7061592276	5	Many Many comments from others
8e97d9f4-73b9-4f7f-b36a-5058bede59a5	5	This is easy to assemble and holds a lot of produce. My boyfriend even loved it!
181d74b1-54fd-49de-aef6-1f673b94fa1c	5	These are great! Perfect size, just what I was looking for!
c9a4b583-6e8a-492a-b3fc-36617ec1092e	1	This is the 3rd Brita water pitcher I've owned. Something is clearly wrong with the electronic indicator light. It indicates that the filter needs to be changed immediately. I've owned this model for 2 months, and it's indicated I need to change the filter at least once per week -- and just now, after replacing the filter AGAIN and filling the pitcher with water, it says I need to replace the filter AGAIN. The item is sold by Amazon, and it's now past the 30-day return window -- but there's no way to contact Amazon about this obviously defective product.
99860b29-348e-4487-84db-f9e4ab2c0a94	3	Way too big and heavy.  I'm a Betsey fan yet these are just too heavy and dirty looking.
2b9aa664-ce7f-449d-8399-8db937d79676	4	They are cute...for a kid's lunch box, but the coolant doesn't stay solidified for as long as one of the regular cylindrical or square kinds.  Not effective; just bought them for the cuteness factor.  Should probably give them to my five-year old niece.
0ee77575-0099-42a5-9eec-cba604e6d000	5	Awesome product
a07d1283-8200-4552-80d4-ea6eaf81bbaa	5	Great value. Works well. Been enjoying some nice veg noodles. Fast and easy. Perfect for 1 or 2 person dinners.
c8b1aecc-494a-430d-a8bb-fdafdd590942	5	This glass is awesome. It's very humorous and durable, and my sister loved it as a birthday gift.  She's used it twice already and it's a good conversation piece.  Thank you for a great product!!
ea896fc1-0346-481b-807c-e07aa1998946	4	We've only just purchased our Keurig, and so far we love it. The only complaint is the seemingly longer than normal 'warming' time that the machine takes. I don't remember this happening on other Keurigs. Even with the extra time though, it still beats my old coffee maker when it comes to the amount of time it takes to get my coffee ready before work.<br /><br />Thanks Keurig, for the free pods for this review!
320611e2-1fad-42be-aa70-24a850955184	5	Love them. Look great and work with almost any outfit.
615a48b4-635b-465a-8837-158a3b2b029b	5	No, they do not look like real diamonds, but they do look high-quality. They are beautiful and sparkly, and the size is just right. Best possible CZs at this price point.
2a397141-4d29-4287-a94c-d3a220a34606	5	After breaking yet ANOTHER glass carafe that I use with our Melitta drip filter, I decided to go another route.  I ordered a Zojirushi SH-HA10XA Stainless Steel Thermal Carafe and this filter cone.  Simply couldn't be happier.  It works exactly as expected.
96d5230c-2edc-4265-9c6d-c85f2ebb8db7	5	Beautiful !!!!
9988a1ea-e217-4f29-abb5-958aae7919a5	3	These rings are much darker on the website photo, which I prefer.  They are more light gray in person.  The bands are quite thin and look &#34;ok&#34; on the finger.
46d2e5e4-f0bd-4533-ac43-47e416ff93e9	1	These were way too small, even smaller than an infant.
4c99cd1d-ed76-46de-979e-cd76a1e506af	5	Very nice ring sizer, light and less noise in compare of the metal one
c12b7759-2385-4183-bf42-99b34195be20	5	Love this necklace!  It is so simple yet very beautiful! Looks exactly as pictured I have been complimented numerous times since receiving it last week! Great buy you won't be disappointed!
bd2c7eed-d81f-4d66-9f3f-e5d50c312f37	5	I am a man of many socks and these helped organize them much better than what I was doing. It's easy to do by color and style.
7987bafc-675c-479c-80c2-f8c3cd354661	5	The pumps usually go out on these after a year or so but they work great up until that time.  I wish this brand made a newer model!
870f1ba6-ab73-44ba-af23-bfd030226024	5	It doesn't really good like the picture, it looks darker and more plastic looking, but I liked it.
be9a7d72-f3a5-457e-a748-dfe2828f57b2	5	Awesome necklace! I purchased it for my girlfriend and she loves it! It's just the right size not too big and not so tiny that you have to strain to see it
342bc356-b54b-4e76-a50f-4ecbb2777e48	3	It is a nice blender but has a ridiculous lid on the glass container.  The lid has a pouring spout with a flap on it which is fine but also has a fairly large hole in the center of the lid, so when you put in to much liquid there is liquid shooting out and up the center hole.  Luckily for us we have our old glass blender container we could replace it with.  I would be looking for a blender with a better lid...NO HOLES!
c0c3e8bf-f2a2-43ed-8afb-eea22a786d9c	5	Item was what was described. Also great service.
3d542aa3-c565-4977-a462-5629acf5601d	5	These  are beautiful!<br />They match my necklace  that I have had for years. The pearls look real so when u matched them up with my real pearl necklace  they were a perfect  match.
550857b6-5c03-44b9-8813-785bc2296424	4	Very pretty, although it's not as clear as expected, a bit small but I have thin fingers so just nice!
