5	d95bbe28-71ea-4b9a-8a3b-77d245766963	Works perfectly!
2	88ca9249-c177-405a-b744-2e351a94fcb8	Too heavy and over-sized. The quality is low
5	21910122-3676-4150-b1b0-256868a634b8	item as described
2	290296ea-0206-4d0b-b7e7-0c3c2609c13e	This is very light weight.  Almost like a disposable item.  I was hoping to keep it on my dining room table permanently, but it's not quite up to that level.
5	1fef9581-799b-4ec1-90f8-c48c506376a0	Looks great in my kitchen, I love penguins....and Seaworld.
5	ab42b690-be52-40b5-a4ea-28e88e47df0e	I like this Malachite bead strand. Thank you for low price and good quality.
5	f91b02d0-0525-4ea3-a9d7-d658ec8c08b5	perfect for my sons medical tags..
4	651e7abf-1efe-4864-9650-718b156ff1d4	Perfect size for cooking for 1 or 2 people. Anything more and it becomes time consuming to load and unload. Still a great product.
5	540d0439-3b80-477b-a05c-420845724217	I ordered this for my husband and he really love it.
5	52fa758f-dea8-47c9-962a-6bdc704e4314	Good size and accurate. I've been wanting a scale for a while and this one is nice and compact. Can hold 2 good size steaks or a bowl.
2	0b462703-f50d-4a09-9a5e-66b5426359c0	BLUE SAPPHIRE TOO SMALL
3	50c40578-0d5a-4c13-8fcd-92cf597755ad	Cheap.....
3	cd1b8922-938f-42bb-afa6-67527d49aa03	The only bad thing that did not ask to 9 inches , I ordered the 8-inch
5	f0f15b00-3fac-4f44-9de3-e9d3ffd0e7e5	It was a bit big for my nose but I squeezed it a little and now it fits my nose perfectly. I love wearing it for pictures and people think that I've actually gotten my septum pierced.
5	14f27888-1a6e-4b65-bc2f-3e95dee278ce	the look just like on the pickture, love them
5	acdf54e5-9bdd-43c2-90fb-a96d19e5ef0a	Very pretty stone and setting
5	119afab6-8666-4ca3-8f56-a1b550c7819c	Love these Tentacle wraps!  Great quality & workmanship.  Beautiful in person.  I actually converted one of them into a pendant for my necklace project.  It looks Great!  Vendor shipped quickly but has Very Poor Communication.  Never responded to my question put weeks ago - So if you have a question, better ask somewhere else or do your own research like I had to do  : )
5	8951b890-3596-4144-893d-3bf84b41293f	Love this, works great, been using it for a while now and I can say it is one of the best mivrowaves I have had both looks and usability wise. I would highly recommend and the wife loves it!
5	49633707-895e-43da-8ee1-470a13ad0f00	This Gold Chain Necklace with 24K Gold Overlay is 30x thicker than ordinary plated gold so it should hold-up much better over the years. This chain is just 1mm thick, so it's lightweight and thin enough to fit most charms over the small clasp to wear around my neck. I think this chain has the look and feel of real gold and is unisex so that both men and women can wear it. I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5	886fe965-38be-43e5-a42b-1e7e2c8eae0a	makes chopping onions so much easier!!
5	f282c81f-bd75-4959-b235-729e60577943	I absolutely love these gloves! I use them any time I am handling anything hot. I have weak hands and, as an added bonus, they give me a great grip. They are too big for my hands, but they work great anyway. I wash them with dish soap and hot water one glove at a time while wearing it, then hang them to dry. Great product! I bought these at a reduced price for my review.
5	e17687dd-ecef-4ef9-aa25-ba64dfa2cb5e	High quality product made of extremely durable materials. This seemed like the best combination of price and quality I could find, and I am not disappointed.
4	07433e27-bf86-49af-8831-526c82d49288	This Oster Immersion Blender is a great tool for blending soups & sauces and making smoothies and baby food.  It has a lot of power and works well with potatoes and fruit.  The only issue I have with it is that it has too much power for some uses.  It says it is a 2 speed blender, but unfortunately those speeds are fast and faster.  You must use a deep container or the contents will be sprayed out of it.  The included plastic cup works very well and I suppose any cup with that height and diameter would also work well.<br /><br />If it had a slower speed that would make it suitable for blending smaller amounts in smaller containers, I would give it 5 stars.
5	3fb17f46-cb96-4a9c-b635-03b1019cc1c3	Awesome product and love it
5	5304729d-a9aa-45c0-a399-998c8400d18e	Looks, works, feels great. Love the new clip spot on it.
3	aeb9facf-7fef-4c99-b52f-a291426d2bed	The ring looks very nice. I bought one for myself and one for my son. The price is right, but the shipping cost is ridiculous.
2	e0767353-7b94-49b4-b848-38177dd96ba6	These are not $100 mugs.  If you are looking for something for the occasional mule, these work.
5	57d25b57-ff6b-4eb4-ae1b-18152f2a47fd	Great cake toppers
3	40c59ec2-a0f0-420b-88d0-bc0bb135fe45	VERY top heavy. If you have a shallow naval piercing, it will flop forward. It is made nicely, just does not work for me.
5	dd22d7e0-5944-42a9-b66c-865d5280bd9e	Beautiful ring! Perfect fit!
3	dbe54ba8-bfc7-4d6f-b112-03036ef8e51a	OK
5	305d8633-1e2e-403e-abc6-5369563f49eb	Nice post length and true to size. Exactly what I wanted
5	419d8142-c88a-460c-8cd4-8538b9a473ed	Great!
2	967aedc0-6137-4eef-b5cd-3fe9d6f1b391	Nice ring and looked as pictured. I rated 2 stars because the Lotus broke off and the ring broke within 6 months.
4	a18cef35-51f7-46e7-8e6a-8d50dedee556	Great at making toast, probably better than any other toaster oven for that specific purpose.  Other things require more guesswork.  We are still trying to perfect the art of chocolate chip cookies.  Some of the controls feel a bit limited like the timer and heat adjustments.
4	29a75118-12f0-4d0b-8a87-5ff529fc7fd8	Actually love the product.  However, the glasses are stacked when shipped, and one arrived cracked and unusable.
4	fbee28b6-b557-42b7-9899-527b6cf1f9ff	They look nice! Although a bit smaller than expected...
2	a70f847f-dab6-4649-ab48-2f794130f672	Received it on the day promised. I have the previous model so, this review will be a comparison. PROS: Taller oven area (about 1/4&#34; more) so although still not as roomy as my  B&D (in toaster-oven heaven), finally, I can roast an open-faced deli sandwich. Larger oven window. Overall size of the appliance is about the same as the previous model. HB kept the toaster lever; thank Goodness as that is easier for my elderly father. CONS: The image is deceiving. Although the toaster opening is about the same (1-1/4&#34;), unbelievably, the space between the grills that holds the slices was greatly reduced to a mere 3/4&#34;! We routinely have Costco bagels that you have to slice yourself; even if you're wide awake and cut the bagel evenly, you'll find yourself coaxing the slices between the grills - now, if you toast only bread slices, you'll be fine. It may be my appliance, but the oven door hinge is not tight enough to keep the door closed; if I tilt it forward slightly to do some clean-up, the door swings open and slams on the counter. As mentioned in a previous review, there is a beep that sounds for every darn thing you do .. plug in, unplug, turn on the toaster and when it's done. The worst beeping is when it's done ... 3 or 4 long, annoying beeps with 2 second intervals. Would have been okay if it was just one, but for crying out loud, HB, there are those of us who are up very early with the family still asleep ... now, we're having to rush to shut it off so that the rest of house doesn't wake up at 5am. 2 stars for keeping the toaster feature separate and for the larger oven area. However, HB took steps backwards with the toaster slot reduction and that annoying beeping for everything! After this morning, I'm not so sure we'll be keeping this one.
5	18249797-6bcf-40d4-bf99-20237b6ef3ed	The mechanism for the clasp is something I had never seen before, but it's surprisingly stead-fast! Amazing! I love how comfortable it is too. Nothing digs in to my flesh, and it looks cool as all get out! Thank you!
4	eec61f08-83e0-4f4e-983e-43884cb834b9	My paralyzed wife loves this Double Heart though the chain is too short for her to see it unless she uses a mirror.
5	68edb75d-ff01-444f-b4eb-b7e5099636fe	Although I like the design of this clip, it doesn't stay clipped to my tie.  Fell off three times the first day.  There isn't enough spring tension to keep it in place.  Updated Sept 5, 2015 The company not only accepted my return of the clip that had no spring tension, they sent me a replacement, for free.  This one looks and feels like it will stay clipped on a tie so I'm assuming the other was just a fluke.  Great customer service to go well above and beyond.
3	da61bcb7-d0b3-4524-a387-3d1e2ea502d4	Really nice but smaller than what I hoped for. The space between the rows is to small to hang another set of dangling earrings with out it getting all bunched up. I ended up using just the top and the bottom rows. It is cute but I wish it was bigger. Also, it is well made.
4	2aaa030a-fc79-4f41-a3d2-c1a1997b97e4	These are pretty decent for the price. I have a lot harder of a time getting these to seal, however. I usually end up doing a double seal to make sure they stay closed. The few times I didn't, I ended up with a slow leak.<br /><br />You can go premium and overpay for the Food Saver brand ones, but I think most of the time these are just as good. They do the job.
5	1b652740-25b8-4723-b264-59814e394d8b	I would recommend to just about anyone...great quality...great price
5	e44b9442-6f8e-4894-8c47-5f5e1e9a0827	Great value
3	a0d00114-e174-4e2c-b99e-d7a68d17532f	I love it. It looks exactly as expected. My only disappointment is I saw it on living social for half the price.
4	ce32b179-f0ea-473d-b912-173a632001de	I recently moved into a house with no ice maker, so I ordered one of these (though it's from eBay, saved $70). I have to say so far I'm pretty impressed. It makes decent sized ice and is super quiet which is a plus since I have to keep it in my room. I'm a little bummed that it doesn't keep the ice frozen, which I didn't realize but everything that melts gets made into new ice so it works out. Will be buying one of these for my mom.
5	810370e9-4456-4ba1-a26c-f707136a04a2	Easy, straight firward and one hell of a cup of coffee! It takes a little patience but it pays . The only thing I recommend is to pay attention to your grind, you dont want it too fine. A regular grind should be fine. Also a heat difuser is not neccessery but very nice to have, though heavy aluminum foil works too if you dont have one yet. I really enjoy this method of brewing, its become my weekend ritual.
4	72db976c-c2c8-482e-99e8-78745752be9b	Needed this for an event, worked out perfectly
5	2d0693cd-7475-48fe-943d-1eb444a7cc9f	very cute, love it
5	e5466a9b-1ef1-4a07-8ec5-bfd8c94eeb25	Love my popsicle molds! They don't hold a whole recipe (I probable needed a bigger size), but I just put the rest in a glass container. Run under water to loosen from the sides to enjoy. Very happy with my purchase
5	f3436acb-e082-4338-8f31-03ebd0ae95bb	I just received the product and thank you very much.<br />It's very nice and wonderful. I love it.
5	d5973203-b8f9-44cd-857a-093caa1a556a	Just exactly what I need.  Very pleased.
3	6a277909-3b88-4e28-b450-59602416f1f0	How ever made this to me it's was made for little girls
5	598a71b5-3a5d-44da-b1ce-b5703c280f37	These were exactly what I expected, great price and great quality!
1	993d5adf-4ade-4a2c-bec9-36d131b6298a	this unit as received was too loud for an occupied room. It's fans and compressor cycled very frequently which was a big distraction in our den. Then after a little more than a year it quit working completely. No repair manuals at the website. No schematics and troubleshooting steps in the instruction manual are useless. I have conclude this particular piece of Chinese junk is a waste of money and heartily recommend NOT buying it.
5	ba1ec894-160d-43b6-b7c3-fe6b825d2d40	This is the best pan! I've used it for brownies to make them extra fun. The kids just love it when I use this pan. Great price as well.

5	25767218-a029-4263-adb7-cbcb763e1e5d	Very good looking pendant.  Can't beat the price!
1	f5715cef-ec6d-45d5-9af2-8e6d50f3edce	Cute concept but poorly made I was so disapointed looks like it was made from a tin can
5	23bd433d-8e74-41f8-a3c2-52907c809a77	Just got my new ring and am very happy with my purchace. Great quality and great price. And only took 2 days to get here.
5	53e2bbbd-b184-4e34-9071-bb1eaa0e5dbf	This wine opener works great, you don't have to worry about breaking the cork or the lip of the bottle.  Makes a great gift along with the Vacu Vin Wine Saver.
5	ba41ac60-29e5-4f85-b7ff-dc3e611a8f8e	My girlfriend love this necklace
2	f174db82-1d72-4fcd-bd84-227f6d3d7c19	some pieces were bent & the case was cracked and dirty
4	127c6cec-3c6e-4d90-855b-b493c36c3731	The first time I used it, it worked, however, it also broke my egg cup.
5	8409e4b3-e581-43fd-af64-121744145d5e	Such beautiful pink crystal color in this rosary.  It is just beautiful.  The workmanship, price and fast service was excellent.  I would purchase from this seller again.
4	533bdb5c-c6ad-4cd6-b907-0163e07d0047	These earrings are lovely but actually a bit larger than I expected.
5	5670387f-84ab-46cc-b204-a0ad2758a3fe	I love it! I replaced the cord with one I made but the amulet itself it great!

3	f8f28381-06aa-42fb-920a-231d3a831a7e	They are pretty for a young girl.  The blue is very dark.  The quality is not high, but neither is the price. You get what you pay for.
5	c8dd7cef-5fec-49b8-a7b0-400a7dde64fa	thank you
5	8afd8bf7-d2f0-487a-9f9f-858cc0995e99	Excellent!
5	422941cf-3106-4924-8ede-8436983a7909	Everything as advertised! It froths perfectly and fast. Great addition to the Keurig.  My son also likes it because he can make a fast hot or cold chocolate milk.
5	721a0c02-e8fc-475f-8d37-257c898f3703	Very pretty. Nicer than the picture
5	64893fae-53d6-41da-8c33-8c9aeaa3bcf3	Keeps food cold all day long and the zipper is a great addition!
4	fdb6ffb4-3c18-4ea3-8d5c-bd159677edaf	Size is much larger than I thought it would be but it is good quality.
5	9a969ea5-c221-40bb-8d9b-c79c8315f24f	The jars were exactly what I wanted.
5	ae69ce72-c293-4285-a8db-3e0e8232d029	It is very nice , not too long to be the charm for a bracelet , size is perfect. Prompt delivery and friendly seller. I highly recommend them!!!  :)
4	36a60fe8-7b41-4076-aa75-eb3d09af2b78	Item is exactly as posted.
5	ac96af78-b25e-4c39-a9b4-f7b78b5926b6	Very pleased with the quality and that it's airtight.
5	ba38d7db-a3db-4506-927d-5203250c296a	Sometimes it makes sense to purchase the name brand! I had purchased non-brand name to save money. They worked so poorly not sealing and leaking I thought my Food Saver machine was broken. I ordered these bags and everything worked great! They vacuum seal like they are supposed to with no leaking. They even sealed Florida Spiny Lobster without leaking or sharp edges poking through! I will only purchase this branded product in the future!
5	77761182-df4b-4abd-861d-e5420076ee4f	We agree with Consumer's Guide and others on this site that this is the very best toaster oven on the market.  The convection oven option cooks everything perfectly even; including casseroles and frozen pizza.  The toaster cooks the bread on the bottom and the top quietly, so you have to watch it until you find out which heat choice you like the best.  I like 3 for English Muffins and 2 for regular bread. I am very happy to find one that really does a great job.
5	2a78be68-550c-4e1b-933e-5509fb352b0a	Lovely little glasses!  Very lightweight but substantial and easy to hold with the dimples in the sides.  Perfect for a shot of espresso!
5	8885df35-9188-4e5f-b811-9e0fc185102d	One of my favorite pieces of jewelry. :)
2	02524306-13b6-4ed8-a20d-2d6cdcb09b41	The printing is not like the picture, it didnt seem like a butterfly, the wing are not clearly defined. I diceded to buy this because I have one in pink and I love it, unfortunatelly this purchase doesnt meet what I expect, is nothing like the one I all ready have.
5	61a6cc37-a3f0-4237-b650-9e37bce273b2	fantastic… easy to cook and use…
5	5afcb4b0-858f-47e6-8bf3-b2b0ba15f3ac	This is the perfect size hoop for me and my nose and I love the black.
5	8ff699bf-b530-4db0-b3c1-fa7229251693	love it cold water and ice last all day
3	16b74eac-a908-4d5a-b582-f1f206ab9dc5	Looks and feels &#34;cheap&#34;.  Not substantial at all.
5	a443b124-bd0e-4e55-8bd6-39a5204d8642	Beautiful. Not cheezy
5	8d7e8c4d-1c62-4070-be62-5a253a25568a	VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !!
3	2d9354d6-e859-4539-81d1-d77b746e4073	They're ok, but they don't stay frozen as long as other ice packs I've used... probably because they're thinner. But they work in lunch bags just fine and the price was right. However, if I could have found the others I had, I'd pay more because I know they'll stay cold hours longer.
5	5aad556b-3790-4943-9156-d9ef2b23f078	I love love  it!!
5	f8ea0a5c-20bb-423d-962c-962d149ecea9	I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she is  absolutely thrilled with it.
3	8a5e6cc8-a15d-40ec-9187-430d3b732092	I love them, but no where in the description does it say it has or doesnt have shaker tops. I had to return them, because they dont
5	18826f54-fd4c-46fa-b3f0-764d5070eb0f	my favorite thumb ring
5	39a22fb4-2a7a-43fa-a90e-62da4bc9b73e	The quality is better than I expected. The metal is sturdy and very shiny. It is a quality chain and charm. I cannot believe the price; what a deal. I would definitely purchase this product again.
3	b96f7843-aeac-4ecf-b0bf-5ce86d178d43	The idea was great and they work alright. We wanted to get these so we could put ice cubes in small neck reusable water bottles. Standard ice cube trays make ice too big. These ice cubes work, but if there is any overflow and the water is coming across the top of the squares, good luck getting that huge chunk out of the tray. Filling these takes some skill that I have not developed yet. Right now, as these sit in my freezer, only half of each tray is usable. The other half is stuck to the tray. No amount of bending and flexing has been able to dislodge the slab of ice. My advice, if there is any overflow, dump it out and try again. I also do not have the patience to fill ALL the squares. It takes a fair bit of patience to fill all the squares.
4	ca089e1a-b5b2-439b-8365-30aba560eaaf	Was a little disappointed with how big it is for my hand but the color is real nice.
4	a26e76c9-7a8f-4f43-8186-a7700aff5789	Very happy with them.
5	6bb95806-4111-4d0e-87a5-14ef0501fd7c	Love this mug but you have to be careful with it.
5	1891f729-4f40-4d2c-bde0-2a8791d834ce	Love it, and it fits snugly and perfectly on my pyrex measuring cups.
5	ed784933-4008-4566-902b-5fdfca103ae9	Just as described !
5	dde5670a-bf46-492c-8aa4-70c74918a249	Great look nice
5	33480fb5-7f8f-435f-be9a-53c27b576cf2	Love this pendant. The size is small enough to be perfect for a woman, but still large enough to be eye-catching.  Many compliments. Highly recommend Bico products
5	1f17cc0b-2a5c-48ef-8189-a87e2a280952	Love it!!!
5	aa866c8a-b7dd-45af-b7ac-e1677d0b6c7f	Beautiful ring. Wish it fit more of my fingers but looks awesome on my pinky!
5	f2961995-0225-43c0-b40b-8c1fe8831a94	good
5	9064f49f-831c-4b4a-9324-6273fb3c2952	super cute looks just like picture and works exactly as described I wish I'd known about these a long time ago
5	3b178e71-73de-4f5a-850e-4f210b5e5833	Perfect lunchbox solution! Great size for sandwich and two compartments perfect for sides. Nice and roomy. If I pack something that might leak (such as yogurt), I just put a little cling wrap over that compartment. We used our first set non-stop for the past year and are now updating with brighter colors. We usually wash on bottom shelf of dishwasher.
4	3ccd89ee-1613-4fe7-b291-fcf53e870bc7	Working well so far.  School year just started but it's keeping lunch cold so far. :-)  And - they're cute so that's a bonus. :-)
5	4afd20bd-5b27-4da2-959d-31383f7581f6	Exactly how it looks. Although the chain was pretty short and I would've prefer for it to be longer.I still  however really love this product!!
5	d480488d-8819-4aab-96cc-2e9d367eda14	Excellent unit. For what it does and how often we use, the battery life isn't that bad. I'd buy for a gift and recommend to friends.
3	86565144-2d06-4eb3-bed9-e8e804526a1d	Until this morning I was going to headline my review &#34;World's Best Toaster&#34;. Our previous unit had worked reliably for six years, which we know because Amazon tells me I purchased it in June, 2009. The LEDs started dying off about a year ago, and now it is mostly comatose. Time for a replacement. And the reasons for going with the same model are: (1) makes toast properly; (2) slots and retainer wires work for any bread, muffin or bagel; (3) has not electrocuted any family members or pets; and (4) has not burned our house down.<br /><br />This morning, the shiny replacement unit died after three days of casual use. Six years of service on one, and not even six days of service on the replacement. I am sure this is due to POOR QUALITY CONTROL which allows them to ship an improperly assembled unit, or possibly POOR DESIGN which leads to a high level of &#34;infant mortality&#34; as I see by other reviewers.<br /><br />For the price, this is INEXCUSABLE. I could get an unreliable toaster for one-tenth the price if I wanted one.
3	6e9c0884-0a67-4130-ba2d-2459029fc98e	I loved the design, and the color. My son is autistic and I thought  it would be nice to wear some awareness. Unfortunately, the clasps are no good!  The bracelet will not stay on. I had ordered 2 so I could give the other as a gift, but the clasp was no good on either one. I was disappointed. Oh shipping was almost a month.
2	5c00b5a1-c822-4379-a155-2e28af95035d	The item says that it comes in a &#34;deluxe medium box&#34;. I was counting on this as I was giving it to my wife as an anniversary gift. Instead, the earrings came in a tiny zipper bag in an envelope. Much smaller than they appear in the pictures.
5	124c4f42-3e63-4c19-bdaa-418c983779b6	This is a well made necklace. heavy enough and looks great on. the earnings are nice enough too and compliment the necklace. A good buy.
5	3dccdf63-8dc7-4c50-9ffd-e0698a40e105	Love, love, love my wooden cutting boards. The only thing I would suggest is the seller posting how to make a wood conditioner with beeswax and coconut oil. I had to hunt online for a recipe of what ratio to use to melt it together. But they do supply directions on just using the coconut oil, which is also nice -- I just wanted a little more protection on mine, and they suggested beeswax, but I didn't know how to use it was all. But I really liked the directions given on how to clean the board and how to keep it conditioned, etc. I thought I needed to sand it more when it came, but I think the wood is just a softer wood, because it seemed like the more I sanded it, it never got super smooth. So, a mention of that also would be nice on the directions as, I don't think I really needed to sand it anymore - it's just a grainier type of wood that has that rougher feel, and no amount of extra sanding will really get rid of that, so while it might still need to be sanded some when it arrives, don't expect it to feel completely smooth like some wood. And my husband hears me say, every time I use it, how much I love my wooden cutting boards. This one looks beautiful once it's conditioned.
5	38bf000a-68b8-4781-b1af-82385a50dfd1	Even I can open a wine bottle!!
5	8b20b667-b8df-4c8d-ab5f-8004007cd532	Great product!  Store your T-disks in this and you can set other things on top of it, maximizing shelf space.  If the drawer squeaks a spritz of household oil will silence it.
5	c4624aed-aac8-427f-8ca9-ab4ba50adeb2	This makes the prettiest soaps and lotion bars!! The pattern comes out so very nice.  It isn't very deep so the soaps and lotions are on the smaller side.  I put several together as a gift set and it was very well received.  Washes easily too.
5	1e50a4c3-dad1-41ed-91e1-6fdd4c67f484	The ring is very pretty and fits perfectly.
5	226d190f-ee69-4804-8148-8b1cb6836eb3	it is for my God Daughter just the right size
5	ca9c7465-deaf-4ddf-b1f7-be2155625aaa	Love this thing, perfect for cooking
4	b59d01c1-f7ef-4328-b25a-b8916e66c77b	Very light weight with a nice pop of color.  Just wish the fish hook was a little longer, I needed to bend it so it wasn't horizontal in my ear.
4	cb280540-f8e4-4dd6-be57-0dffdc33bb1b	Very nice, pretty and quite dainty!!
3	66151daa-a123-41aa-860b-6c2254826798	Nice stones but for ruby colored stones They were too orange
4	ca06d2fb-09fa-4420-a627-06e42d5f01b5	Does the job. Mine didn't come with a clear lid though ]:
5	155b8ab6-0560-4732-8f68-6cb1a2bf2318	These were adorable for my daughter's tea party, I cut out watermelon tea pots and cups. They were a big hit!

2	c0d0cec5-5447-4a43-bbba-ecb4fe2450d5	Very cheap metal.
1	753e6ce2-c17f-4f6f-89e2-ed5320591a85	It doesn't fit my industrial piercing, then angle of the cross or however it was fitted makes it impossible to fit into my ear, not to mention it looks cheap and glued on.
5	b323179c-edf3-4125-af50-2c16b0d9db7e	J.A. never disappoints and this was at a steal of a price. Cuts through everything like butter, easy to use and to sharpen!
5	2f39805f-7c53-4d8c-b112-5b5bef7eae89	My sister loves this, sometimes forgets to put out frozen food and this makes her life easier.
4	5c906874-51d8-451b-b501-32905cf75034	Great product for price. Nice length. Not too long not too short.
5	22670bf2-e5ca-473d-9fa2-055f92f24bbf	Very nice bracelet. The pearls are very good. Very satisfied with the purchase.
5	84ea1638-3e98-4d4e-8128-25a7386344a6	I got this lunch/dinner bag for my husband to take with him to work. He usually takes them in a grocery bag, so he can just throw it away if when it was empty. This is a much better way, no more trash to add to our landfills. I just love that it has reusable containers inside. They are great sizes as well. He has diabetes so I can give him portion control meals that look neat and appetizing. He is less likely to stop at the cafeteria if he has a nice looking meal to sit down to.<br />The whole unit is very well made and easy to carry. It has an attachable shoulder strap so you can just throw it on and out the door you go.<br />This bag makes an excellent alternative to the old traditional brown bag.<br /><br />* I received this product at a reduced rate to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion.

5	2d2c83cb-b154-4979-8b72-ec1ae1e5d067	Bought this for our daughter for her Birthday in September a few months ago.  So Beautiful I couldn't wait and gave it t her for &#34;just because&#34;.  She has not taken it off once and she absolutely Loves It !!  So glad I bought !!  She is 29.<br />Great buy for the price !!
4	7581c630-9bde-4456-bb79-c431d416a121	I like it.
3	ca182c03-fde3-4a36-876f-88438588c609	Great price and product for what I used it for (photo booth back drop). Product is thin and fragile. Recommend buying more then one. I bought two and combined them together to achieve the look I wanted. Length and width is also a plus.<br />Would not recommend using this where there will be lots of traffic (door way etc). It will not hold up for more then five minutes. I would recommend using it where there is no traffics like I did.
5	e38880bf-aeb4-4956-b799-95e9e7198c5b	Beautiful

5	ed4e5a6b-8c18-432b-b8ac-e0b869ff0bb0	[[VIDEOID:f9a1fe0b28d06e627f314f16cebf8cc5]] The problem I have with larger blenders is that I always end up making too much smoothie for a single person (me) to drink. So when I was offered this smaller, single-shot blender as a free sample, I jumped at the offer.<br /><br />Sure, this blender does not have the power and durability of a VitaMix -- but it's also not hundreds of dollars and so big as to lead to oversized beverages. This little blender packs some power, as I demonstrate in my video, and is a very easy to use little bottle-blender. Note that the blender container is the on-the-go blender, which is really quite clever.<br /><br />................................<br /><br />Final note: I received this item as a free sample under an agreement that I would offer entirely objective and honest feedback.
5	e0aa3ec5-0d7a-4cf9-8325-2aa59be6bfc7	Even though they were exactly as described, no one notices them on the tables. I loved them, but would not buy them again for what I used them for, which was to put on the tables under the dishes that were served. Very nice I thought.
4	e0bca2e7-7494-4b26-95f5-646511aacbb0	Would give it 5 stars except a stone fell out of one of them within a week.
5	0b80c0ac-c44b-47d4-a321-86768cc7a989	Best wine stoppers I own! I use them all the time.
5	3cabeba0-5de4-4d7e-aa06-34b7188ed615	If you are just blending protein shakes, this does the job amazingly. However, if you intend to blend more coarse or hard items such as ice cubes or whole carrots, it does admittedly struggle. Very easy to clean, not too loud, two sizes of blending containers, I always prefer the smaller one because it mixes it faster and is easier to clean, and it even comes with a lid for on the go and I small menu for things to make with it, although I have yet to really use that. Given the choice, I would definitely purchase this again, especially juxtaposed to its cheaper or equally priced counterparts which are tacky looking and inefficient, or its more grossly expensive counterparts which do little more than this would, bar the extra torque. A great buy overall, completely recommend if on a budget!
5	2b3cc9ff-7b5a-4f74-994b-101ee28ae420	Now i Matcha in style
5	ce6ca486-a1cd-448b-b69a-99b229d2c7da	This thing is pretty big and probably won't fit into most cup holders, but then again, it's not built for that sort of thing.  It keeps my drinks ice cold all day and fits the 'wide mouth' attachments made for the hydro flask containers.  I have both a hydro flask (40oz) and this Lifeline (64oz) and their performance for liquid insulation is the same.  I picked the 64oz Lifeline container over the hydro flask one because of price and also for looks.
5	0bb50e66-3494-4c9f-b9ed-8d0af97c5151	So much better than the old plastic ones...

5	0e774802-e24c-4f90-8e13-c110fc10831d	My wife loves Pandora but can't justify the price.  She has a few Brighton.  NinaQueen has a line of blings very similar and this studded butterfly is a cutie.  The butterfly has a front and back which has a different look.  There is a big blue crystal on one side and two tiny blue crystals on the wingtip on the other side.<br /><br />Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.
5	ab9189df-339e-4093-8f2b-9cb9bd078abe	This ring is sturdy and well loved by the man in my life. He says it is comfortable and it's fits as expected.
3	d7df2544-5d2b-417b-b0f0-dae4ec2f78e3	This is a genuinely beautiful piece, but ultimately too delicate for my teenager.  After wearing it a few times the thin part of the charm  broke, not to mention that the chain is also VERY delicate as well.  Not to be worn casually I'm afraid.
2	a779a3d9-cb51-49a3-ae8d-be8bffdca410	This ring is very big. If you like that bull ring kind of look then its great but I do not. It is clearly sold as a small ring but the fan much larger than it seems. It does fit ok and its true to color. I'm just very bummed about how big it is.
5	b6e6d0f2-44c1-41bc-83bc-e2113458df07	These things are really cool! (No pun intended. Well maybe a little.) I don't drink beer but I saw these and thought that they would be great as gifts for my family and friends that do drink beer. Curiosity got the better of me. I just had to try these things out but not in beer. I popped them in the freezer overnight. I drink a lot of water and a Coke or orange soda fairly often. I like them really cold. I use ice cubes but as someone else stated they water everything down. In addition I like my water filtered. I do have a filter on my icemaker but there is still an after taste in my ice cubes. Anyway I thought I'd give these things are try. I popped one in a Coke(I wish that I had read the review about a beer fizzing. Sodas do too)  I am so surprised and pleased with these.<br /><br />I am actually going to place another order and get a couple sets for my cousins. They entertain a lot and I think they will really enjoy the Cozy Sticks like I have. Oh, they are made for bottles but I put one in my glass of water and the after taste of the ice cubes is now history!. I know this sounds a bit silly but I really like the company logo. It reminds me of something from years ago but I can't remember what. I just know that it makes me smile whenever I see it. Keep Smiling & Dare to Dream!

4	07653196-16f2-41ed-af2d-c401a06f3efc	At first I was going to give these a bad review sheerly because when the box arrived it was just a bunch of these in an amazon box - as in no brand box or wrapping or anything and they were covered in dust. I was seriously about to return them but I really needed food containers for my packed lunches. I ran them through the dishwasher twice before I used them and I haven't died yet (nor have they). Quality product and I love the cabinet cleanliness they provide with the snap together lids and containers.
5	5f0aa8cc-09c3-49dd-bd48-5dcd44ad0f24	just what we where looking for it far better than the bands  you can get<br /> alread been used as it was bought for so medic very happy with it
5	69739757-05fb-4ced-a5a7-237499c044be	Beautiful! I bought this as a spare ring to wear when we go to a water park, swimming etc anywhere where I may be afraid to lose my real ring. And I chose this one because of it's similar design to my original that my husband paid 3,000 for and this one looks just as good. No complaints love it!
5	d4d14564-5d1e-4471-92e9-dac4f5d8e6b1	Yes, this Jelly Belly Decorating kit is very good.  It's almost a must if you're considering buying an snow/ice cone machine, like I did, but the should snow cone machine should have included these items!
5	74604d70-435c-4371-8eb1-701d6056e714	Smaller than expected but very cute!

5	494e5e22-b4e8-4652-8a9c-e7baa6ea8b86	First things first, I received this ring free for the purpose of review. Hopefully, my observations and impressions will prove helpful to you in your decision making. If you have questions, feel free to post them in the comments section, and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience with the product.<br /><br />What you're getting with this order:<br /><br />(1) &#34;King Will&#34; 8mm Blue and Black carbon fiber inlay Tungsten Carbide ring.<br /><br />What is Tungsten Carbide, and how does it compare to Tungsten?: Tungsten is an element and Tungsten Carbide an alloy. You will find differing opinions, but many feel that Tungsten Carbide is the better material for a ring because it is essentially scratch resistant to anything but diamond. Both have very similar characteristics when it comes to looks, and the two terms are frequently used interchangeably.<br /><br />The &#34;King Will&#34; Blue and Black 8mm carbon fiber inlay Tungsten Carbide ring: This ring features the polished dark silver of tungsten carbide on the outside with beveled edges while a carbon fiber inlay dominates the center of the ring with flecks of blue noticeable. The black of the carbon fiber contrasts beautifully with the tungsten making for a unique and attractive band, and the blue adds a third color that makes this particular ring unique. The inner ring is comfort fit, meaning that it is contoured and is easier to slide on/off your finger compared to flat bands.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a unique Tungsten Carbide ring that by nature of its construction is very durable and highly scratch resistant. It is well represented in the product description photos, but with the actual product, the carbon fiber is actually more visible with the light playing off its modern pattern. The craftsmanship is excellent. I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a durable and stylish band, and at its current price point one has very little to lose. Enjoy!
5	a895f57c-f221-46b2-b232-695afc03c5a0	extremely good service!  Chain is very nice

5	9c2c8c61-0771-4262-86a6-1d5b53c87af8	I love my spiralizer!! This is one of the best made slicers out there!! It feels very secure when using it, I love that the blades fit in the container so you never have to look for them when you need s different size. My son loves making fries and loves the juicer attachment. Thank you for such a great product!!! 
5	d43d0b40-115e-4cf9-bfbd-080fe7d01a59	I bought 2 of these rings and use them as ring guards for my main ring since it's a tad big and plastic ring guards make it too tight. So these thin band rings are just perfect for what I wanted them to do. They are shiny and would go well with any ring you might want to wear it with. Like other reviewers suggested, I bought 1/2 size down and they fit perfectly! I've only had these for about 3 weeks so I can't comment on its wear & tear but will update as any problems arise.

5	24af4fa1-ab2c-4693-a277-432d83ed25ce	So far so good. Lightweight. Doesn't take up any room. Nice design.
5	185063e7-e0d7-4841-b9cf-de29e5027efa	Very cute coasters.  But be aware, they're a little small, most of my mugs just barely fit on them, causing condensation to leak over the edge.  They do work well for normal sized glasses though, and the silicone makes it very easy to clean.
1	9d34067f-0027-4bc6-99b8-6a61ac601d07	Much smaller than expected, more for small child than adult. Very disappointed!
5	40b560b5-a1c6-43e1-8e77-9b7a679c85b3	Absolutely stunning [like all of the service pieces I've ordered from Pacific Merchants in this acacia wood].
4	3cf9af9d-0ef1-4290-852b-b49ca562edde	Started making my own with this kit and loving the flexibility of making my own flavors and not spending and arm and a leg at the grocery store! But hey, my kit didn't come with tea! Wassup with that?

5	65b911e1-3f0e-42b2-ae2a-4f373813dbd0	Beautiful! It's very elegant I am very happy I made the purchase.

4	c1833a7d-d110-442e-9008-e83f8875da81	The earrings look so nice on, better than the picture. So glad I purchased them. It was really nice how fast they were delivered.
5	4ad50b59-3619-45d6-bbe3-80b9e217f8ce	Cheap, works great and gives you so much more confidence when cooking larger cuts of meat
5	a74b3647-c3ab-4dd3-9ed2-abe9d356c0df	I purchased this so I could review it and I am really happy I did!  It's very well made and sturdy. Better than I expected just by looking at pictures. We have used this quite a few times already.  The double size makes it really easy when you have different size citrus as well...  No cutting down to size or using different methods, just flip it and the size changes.  I would definitely recommend this squeezer to anyone that likes quality and a great product
5	521289af-a4b5-42cf-b20b-4b226d9be05d	I thought they were the perfect size and shape for a cold beer. I also like a good pint, but these were great.
5	bf40a135-a005-4d75-bb92-e0a8c7469d32	Simple. Clean. Modern looks. It just works.
4	5e41bf2b-99e7-436f-a76e-dc49da5f8751	Bought this as a surprise for my husband's Man Cave and he loves it! The one I purchased does not look like the photo... Mine is a black base and the football is more of a brown color, but hubby doesn't seem to mind. It's worked well so far with Crispy M&M's.
5	1256a919-f3e8-4c30-94ac-c53f662255d1	Love these earnings not to big and not to small and the price was good. Wish I would have ordered two pairs.
2	10fe7b72-7bd5-4d69-93fe-66269fc986e1	Great bracelet, however does not adjust 6-9 inches.  The smallest it adjusts is 7&#34;, which is too large for my wrist.
5	e7d51404-6ff7-4990-91c8-049e4c4cdccc	Great size!!
3	509371af-cbb4-402e-9e60-9829ebe4ee98	Does a decent job of keeping the coffee hot especially if you preheat the inside with hot water.  Does have a tendency to allow a larger than normal &#34;sedement&#34; compared to glass presses. Perhaps if the inside had a polished finish.
5	5157fc6b-3806-46ab-b38c-3ac727addce9	nice
5	54af6479-7b71-4048-b14e-771aa57ee006	Really nice.
3	8497ccde-6678-44ee-bea8-b150171ab357	I was a bartender for 8 years but since recently getting a better paying job, I realized I missed making some of the fancy cocktails I used to sling over the bar top. I bought this set and, well, it gets the job done. It's definitely very basic and not of the highest quality but I was able to make a decent martini and some trendy shots with it. I will offer this caution though, if you hand wash the shaker, be careful around the edges, I cut the s**t out of my hand on the thin metal.
5	4c6993fa-d2c2-42d5-941c-b872dfbd2140	Great toaster oven
5	9ffb3072-ef87-48ce-b71c-326060b70d3f	This is a stainless steel Masonic ring with a black finish and gold Masonic Square and Compass. It is beautiful. The edges are very smooth and tapered and makes the ring very comfortable to wear. There are seven images of the square and compass around the ring. They are distinct and look very nice. I love it.
4	0b14bfe2-433f-4a2e-8db7-ca3f57ead7d2	The product has a nice weight and is nicely made.  Unfortunately I received the bronze color instead of the silver I ordered.
1	a377534a-d7c8-4ae0-83ff-5f648a9df716	Very very flimsy.
4	8f5ed9f7-85a1-421e-8aea-9c7b4fea9165	Like it. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. Makes great zucchini side dish that my kids love. The only issue is the sharp parts on the unit.  I cut my finger using for the first time.  You cannot let vegetable get to small, and the end piece is worthless.
5	7886ccc2-d534-4985-a0de-1acaed04b259	Good product Recommended.
5	aacb5185-2026-403d-b446-b7fe3464479a	Love it
5	79778f90-642a-4f12-abf4-291329ad84ad	Love it
5	eb299354-b97c-4c1a-ba6a-86b76cf56aea	Very cute and convenient. We no longer get bags at the grocery or other stores so we have to carry our own bags. Can squeeze 3 of these into my small purse. I'm going to order more for gifts.
5	b10233ac-a25e-469a-851d-90ff2021df5b	Shipped quickly and packaged like fine jewelry! Earrings are slightly larger than expected, but still nice enough for everyday. Shiny and not cheap looking. Excellent for less than 5 bucks!
5	99951275-0004-42e5-b73a-d9c41865403b	These are very tiny, but I knew that and bought them for my second piercings and they are perfect!
5	4bbfde62-dfa7-4b62-861f-f3dee3ec36bc	I love that i can adjust it to 2 different lengths.  Happy with my purchase
5	3dcd05bf-3682-4400-b7f3-0c4a285d4bda	Very nice
2	65980728-1b5b-4683-ba85-0a591931a02e	Very ordinary. Nothing special about them.
5	50dc37a8-2af9-4d66-82b9-1e2a5274be69	I tried sistema when I found it on sale at Marshall's years ago. Now I'm addicted. Today I will use Amazon, my go-to supplier, to replacing containers which my girls lost at school, picnics, etc. We use them a lot!  In reading reviews for this product, those who were disappointed seemed for the most part to be using them differently than we are. Lunch and snack items such as  guacamole and  chips, fruits and berries, pretzels, cheese slices, cookies and crackers, other  finger foods, pack beautifully. I claim that I get the colored containers because the little one likes them, but I have to admit that I do too.  However, I don't think these particular containers would work nearly as well for soups or oily foods that could leak. I've put pasta with marinara in them, but would not pack pasta salad with olive oil dressing. I wash them by hand because I don't have a dishwasher. They are easy to clean and don't retain odors (Try denture cleaner if you really have an odor issue). They are pretty tough, and last for years. I have some of the original oldies and they are still going strong.
5	4bbb4464-e6f4-4ae5-abd7-1c507a3242cf	Very nice product
3	8cb7d6c5-39a3-48a8-a26e-698014e6404b	The bag is nice but the handle straps are cheaply made and will break soon. Also, the delivery date was scheduled to arrive within a date range and did not arrive within it so we had to scramble to buy another case, last minute, for my husbands job which created unnecessary anxiety.
1	db13e25e-edfe-4f34-ab94-f66f88ada72a	pretty
3	0e57109e-cce5-4b2b-a3d2-753dbc968425	Really small charm.  But it's delicate looking.
1	4ae3d286-0642-4607-addd-34edf0d8a81b	This item is not 925 silver..poorest of quality, and went directly into the trash!!
3	af8f8870-48b6-4f76-943d-5a863d361fab	The chain is too dainty and the clasp is so small that it is very time consuming and difficult to put on and take off.  Pretty pearl pendant.
5	eb492654-3ad4-42d9-8fe5-b38ab43ced48	Beautiful ring.  Lovely cut.
5	3ba1f880-16a9-4bc0-9918-35ad455a5d0c	This is the coolest thing ever. I need to drink a lot of water, and sometimes I just want to scream it's so boring and tasteless. Now I drink a lot more water and it's great!! Anyone who drinks water should get this. Any fruit. I'm thinking of fresh lemonade, strawberries or even cucumbers.<br />I received this product at a reduced price for my review.
5	afb676d8-9d20-4f17-bcad-10ee3049e829	So pretty! I love it!
5	e6515511-9343-41df-a249-f63085cbacc1	This is absolutely perfect for my daughter! She was so happy to clip this onto her backpack and use it as a zipper pull.<br />You can open this up (it uses strong magnets to hold it closed), and take out, or add charms to the keychain.<br />This doesn't feel like it's going to fall open or anything, but I would still use a bit of caution.<br />The charms inside are super cute, and just totally 'make' the keychain.<br />Overall this is pretty adorable, and we love it!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in anyway.
5	39a23854-52a5-4416-905d-b2e39d8c87c7	Again, I have been extremely impressed with this company.  The colors on this necklace are vibrant and a beautiful representation of Kali.
4	389910aa-2cb7-4acb-aa5a-ec84fe9403ba	I rally like these that only is that the part that snaps on the little handle broke after my second day wearing them...the handle cuff or slot is very tight and really hard to open but other then that they still was a great buy
5	e31036f5-93a8-4607-99f6-e82eeae3cb62	Love this ring! Super comfortable and I get compliments all the time. Good quality fast shipping
5	ab5a0c50-46bd-4464-8b0c-e11de4f779ca	its a beautiful necklace.  very thin and very shiny.it would be very nice on slim person. or if you are like  very small things
4	d4e8bbec-1e0c-47dc-a3b8-00619eea4bd5	This was a birthday present!
5	aaba7510-f6f6-43f7-b7d5-58dba55b5d05	I love authentic Japanese products.  I watch NHK worldwide TV everyday and have learned much about the Japanese way of life.  I am fascinated by their love of the Way of Tea.  Matcha tea to be precise.  Now that I have this genuine handcrafted Hishaku I have everything necessary to have a tea ceremony. Everything right from Japan so all is correct which is most important if I am to do reverence to this sacred custom.  Hai.  This hishaku is lovingly made by a genuine craftsmen who loves his work and has given to the world of his talent.  I will treasure this wonderful implement all the days  of my life.  Hai!
3	e0696a49-6e4f-4956-9f6b-d2819b4232c8	Unfortuntately, I didn't realize that the beads were sooo big, like the size of big marbles.  So instead of if being a gift, it will be given as a &#34;joke&#34; to the person I intended to give it too. The quality and the feel of the beads are lovely and the carvings, it's too bad...it would have been perfect if it had smaller normal size beads.  I didn't realize that 16mm was that big...
5	e314f8a8-7724-4fde-aaa0-91999ba1735c	Excellent packaging and made an amazing gift! I would definitely consider if you have a Snoopy fan in your life!
5	10b99586-73df-47b0-9943-4205f7301009	So fun
5	66e4b34d-66d8-4190-9ac6-86a8acc53369	Excellent  I love it !!
5	7f6041c1-1241-4db1-93a0-75df37ad1b4a	very cute and the shipment was excellent
4	f5d9d85c-4d0f-4a9c-ba57-64ba151cfe95	Item is good and has no plastic parts.  Problem is it was given as a gift so if something does happen it would have to be returned to me so I could file a claim on the extended warranty puchased
5	9ef90123-9ea2-465e-bfa6-9c2b109098a1	Love this product, we use this all the time for baking. Pretty easy to clean, but more importantly we aren't filling the landfills with tons of aluminum foils that will take forever to biodegrade (if it even biodegrades at all).
5	5b15fa45-9b13-4ccc-a1ff-c68f2992de7d	Great product!<br />I've had it for a few weeks now and love it.  Just stick the tofu in and crank down the screws and leave it for a few hours in the sink on its side.<br />Tofu comes out very firm and much easier to cut into slices.
1	e063ee2e-9aa6-46d9-9f8d-82d226ef3085	The first paren of their features -- &#34;To avoid rust, dry immediately after cleaning&#34; -- should be a red flag.  There is no way to avoid rust.  The paint on the rim is cheap, easily chips and is constantly exposed to moisture when in use.  After a dozen uses in five weeks these are ready to discard.
5	43055628-06a1-4bb4-a050-17ced3acddf0	Nice little grocery bag holder. Goes with my kitchen. Hung it up with a Command hook, looks great :)
4	c63ad7fd-ed49-4f24-a3ab-8f79cd074c39	They're nice but alot bigger than I expected. Still nice though. Mail carrier originally delivered to the wrong address so I thought they were lost in the mail. Happens sometimes when getting products mailed from China. Took forever for my neighbor to finally bring to my house. They also appear to be of good quality, not cheap or flimsy feeling like so many Chinese products. Overall pleased with purchase.
5	68498c52-c786-4b61-b571-0f95f2f8ad66	Mine is comfortable and fits great. I wear it as a wedding band.
4	692255d8-d6bc-4ec1-9483-173f1f72cbbc	When this first arrived, I was unsure how it would look or feel. Well I have worn it several times already. I think is looks great, and feels fine. I really like it.
5	fedce8e5-7d9e-4095-9735-f29967002cce	Love this ring. I use this on a daily basis instead of my real wedding band. It's so light. I don't feel anything on my finger. Feels great. Light and pretty. I have also got lots of complete. Looks like gold
4	811249bc-d00c-4e17-949b-fe1f7347a94e	really hard to read the prayer
4	d6be0756-b76e-4f1a-97c2-bdd781c5dde4	Awesome ring it looks even better that the pic my only problem is that the silver band will eventually come right off, then won't stay back on.
5	8af72a49-e1df-4f37-880a-83a31199b278	Extremely useful for eggs. Not much else to say as everyone knows how silicone spatulas are...
4	3af275d2-8f47-41bd-8fec-2cc1f74b2d76	Darker than it looks, ut will keep.
4	aeb31f8f-4f3b-4132-8f6f-06b450d74697	Good quality !  Better vacuum then most others brands of this size.  Great bargain! I only wish you could turn off the vacuum easier.  You can press cancel then press seal.
5	9ff27f00-8e1b-4ade-91e1-a67eb61fd831	This is a really beautiful, elegant bracelet. Solid quality, too. The charm is adorable.
5	d9b4e6d2-6aad-4cc6-9946-25d028dd2c2f	quality ring good price
2	b0a02509-44ac-4d3d-8366-40f11a3aeb6a	This was not what I was expecting, they aren't 18g, they're 16g or maybe 14g, much bigger than what I wanted. They aren't 8mm (5/16&#34;) they're more like 1/4&#34; which is super small. I'm not satisfied at all, the only reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived on August 26th when it was expected to arrive September 11th-28th.
5	6c302cce-0902-4bd7-9e93-e953a4e799e9	Great value.  Very cute
5	99d21372-1d0a-4527-872a-d301a30d8163	😄
5	667ffc38-7b56-457b-9634-559cbe462252	These have saved my life with stretching since the kit I have has short tapers for 0 and 00 and I also needed a step in between 2 and 0 so these were perfect.
5	e1b72a46-c867-4657-b63c-799124f00c85	Excellent product for the price.  Very nice costume jewellery.  Received before expected date.
5	82270885-4eb2-471a-88ba-27a2b04aa066	Beautiful!! Couldn't be happier with it. My fiances loves it.
5	983f453b-424c-416d-b3d5-5dda27f50198	Works great
5	df7cabe7-364a-481c-b373-d58681cb48b3	Lid did not fit right, but otherwise I love it!
5	87ca29a0-dcb1-4fd3-932a-ff8db5884f5c	very good quality and good-sized for little girl. great price!
5	63a9d272-7558-492b-a5de-52e9baf893ea	Very Nice Quality
5	c41cd087-3baf-49e8-a13b-3e401723c178	LOVE THIS SET!! GORGEOUS AND VERY STURDY!! HAVE GOTTEN LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT
5	3639de19-9c00-4634-93ea-bcea567f2ce8	I really think a lot of it . a little big I would like to find a small one next
5	b27b11ba-dc41-457c-9ea3-c3927347711b	These are really nice. They came quicker than expected too. Wasn't sure I would like them but took a chance and was glad I did. Will definetly order again. Very happy w/ my purchase. Thank you.
5	9f431350-eb4d-4719-9183-46c6fb137137	They were just what u expected &#34;Cute&#34;
4	48652e75-8ab8-403b-9fcd-73da33c7d40e	It is good quality long lasting .non sticky .I like Sanyo electronic product .
5	20c4ab28-9cfb-47a3-bf34-b96f6a50a491	Very sharp, well built. Handle is light, but nicely balanced. So far, my favorite knife.
5	d0074486-b4ae-4f7c-a882-753924839398	it was a great gift!
5	36e7aae3-c159-4b4f-8c2c-8779ed118d8c	This is a monster made with quality and great size
5	b4c69ce1-f038-4c1b-9a2b-1f004b5a09b2	Up until now we were always losing or misplacing our measuring spoons. Now, with the magnetic strips, we just leave them on the top of the stove and wala! Always there when you need them.
5	c1e99277-5301-4c62-bb1b-f87c368d24f2	Great shaker. Fits over a standard 16oz pint glass to shake drinks. I've bartended for over 8 years and this is what I use at work and at home.
5	6599b15d-bb3b-4a9e-af9f-33c6d4e5dd33	Love this coffee pot! Finally no pouring of water into the murky bowels of the coffee maker, but instead the sanitary and lovely removeable water reservoir. Truly dripless when getting a cup mid-brew. Easy to clean. Great price. Highly recommended.
3	ce6bf847-cb09-4d28-bdc5-5cac9b12761c	It does the trick! but I would recommend that you spend more and get your money worth.
5	52f6fbf9-a59f-45ac-9dcf-066982660413	Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)
5	322dc037-b16e-4207-a364-444cb004de4b	I've had this probe for exactly two years.  It just today started having an inaccurate reading, I changed the battery but it still reads way under what the temp actually is, I compared it with another thermometer.  So evidently something inside has worn out.  Not a bad run for a $20 device.  It has been absolutely correct for two full years.<br /> I've come back to order a new one, because I love this thing!  I use it for only one purpose and that is to watch the temp rise in my electric teapot which is tall; I insert the probe along with the cold water and within a minute or two it's ready.  Can't be without this thermometer, looked a long time to find a tall one.
1	183222bc-6c0e-4053-836d-60251ac76c1e	Clearly a joke and waste of money
5	6ead0b93-dbcc-40a2-9373-a7beca75dfa3	Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine
5	6ba1fb21-239a-4a67-b95c-b0732ea20566	My wife loved it. Very nice especially for the price.
4	06115c20-629e-4cbe-8912-fd65c269e8a8	haven't used much  but seems adequate so far
1	f317ae10-a8d1-4b66-bfd7-eb5b3f85e146	Does not fit a mason jar - the lid won't screw on when this is in place. Don't buy this product; it's a waste of money.
4	f9deb2ea-d4d8-46bb-99d0-9e2abe3c42ce	The ball is tiny.  However the length of it is a bit long and protrudes a bit.  Perhaps my nose is too thin, I'm not sure.  I find myself pushing it back down frequently.  However, that is offset by the fact that it is tiny and looks good.
5	270a3fae-4678-4cd6-b2d6-f447a97e0208	Nice, heavy-duty pizza cutter.  I'd buy it again.
5	b9df29a6-6ac7-4e80-ba43-13587c660a35	Just what I was looking for, arrived fast 😆
5	41d00159-bcae-437b-bd50-d05ada4e1c4d	Used this for a baby gender reveal worked fantastic. It's a very fine powder and high quality
5	1d0d4fe5-1187-4662-8be5-c0e0f30878e4	The best device!!!!!!! Thanks
5	233775cf-61bc-450f-8bcd-20a8ba6eb32a	So good ring thanks
5	93e82da2-0871-44bf-ade6-107af65698e7	I love this ring, fits perfect.
4	b03f4c6a-76e3-4477-a2e6-11a6339b3ce2	just what I wanted
5	90f8a08d-18bd-4997-832d-6ef36bb66501	Got this for hubby as a wedding ring he absolutely loves it. He wanted something different, something nobody else would consider.
4	3d6d4b30-93e5-4c83-bba6-2ac6184ee0f6	We bought this for our upcoming wedding in September 2015. It looks just like the picture and is easy to put together.
1	20c2d8c0-aefc-4868-bc06-3aafa09fa5aa	It was bulkier in person than it appears online (I thought it would be quite dainty). I did not keep it.
5	a174e28f-cbbe-44db-bfbc-c478eb88ad42	very good product recommend
4	d5211ab9-7546-4724-aada-dc272b88c5dd	Very cute. Post a bit longer than I expected
5	3b837ee7-8e1b-4118-ab90-8540f6929a96	i really like this products.  but i only have on problem with it.  the product description as well as the company's official website state that this product is made of 304 food grade stainless steel..and  i just hope that i can see this information on the container itself.  other than this, i find this product useful, sturdy,  and of very good quality.
5	b06147c5-53a5-40c2-adc7-85798162f860	My favorite pair of earrings now. I have sensitive ears and im not a goddy jewlry wearer. These are perfect i havnt had any comfort problems they are made well. They arnt huge or goddy, just a pretty and classy!
5	20b79fe7-36fd-43b8-9071-0b1c538552ca	The bracelet arrived prior to expected delivery date ( hooray) and was the splitting image of the advertised image.
4	1c321382-5a78-4f53-bc77-58ba068f9666	The necklace is exactly as advertised. Bought it for my girlfriend as part of her anniversary gift and she really likes it, so I have to give a positive review. The &#34;original selling price&#34; of over $1,000 is comical, but I can still appreciate the quality for the price. It's a $300 necklace at best and that's perfectly fine.<br /><br />Very pretty. GF approved.
5	ed01201d-49b6-46a5-aefc-d7cc5dbf2abb	Love these anchor look bracelets. Bought several for my daughter. She loves them and gets many compliments
5	df1d5970-5124-4af3-a16d-5ba2ca969d4a	These are amazing!  Great conversation piece too. I entered the Konami code to get unlimited beer.
5	33d3a2c8-5ce5-483b-805b-3d99eb779b56	just great
5	e71c6f8e-6d95-4370-9143-b131ebf5de33	Well made. Glass is nice and thick and sleeve also fits my other glass bottles!
5	5d1076a6-9b31-49c8-a851-0ebdff3e8c27	Very very small, but super cute for kids.
5	34742a2d-2198-49a6-bf47-204f2e3da7c8	Bought a zester from a big name store...worked about as good as a piece of sand paper...the DRAGONN WORKS GREAT. Needs very little pressure and gives u a lot of fluffy citrus zest.
4	145b7f18-2b15-4883-b924-d324315a1f29	nice
5	67c37712-ab05-471e-810c-b62c3fd675cc	Works well and makes knives sharp enough to shave the hair off a gnats (_!_).
5	74e76c9e-9910-4a00-a667-b6ce9fccdef6	I love these earrings! They look truly expensive but we're just the opposite. They're perfect with a sun dress or jeans and beautiful when doing the town. They make a statement and are noticeable, without being obnoxious. Very classy. Would highly recommend!
4	9c806736-e695-4d68-8287-9522cb5f7cde	we love the coffee options we now have with different flavors available to whoever wants a cup of coffee or tea.  We also have the option of preparing an entire carafe of coffee to serve as necessary, although at times the  refillable carafe pod leaks grounds.  We haven't used the carafe often, so could be we haven't perfected the pod preparation before brewing yet.<br /><br />The water container is large & doesn't need refilling often.  Easy to clean; base is small so does not take up a lot of counter space.  Nice looking system.  We have ours sitting on top of a black pod storage base with drawers of coffee choices, so the morning routine is simple and quick.  We also use just the hot water to make a bowl of quick oatmeal. We love it.<br /><br />Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.
5	0d22f405-d0df-4c23-a1b4-7422b95a84da	Love them!
5	4924d9d9-71d2-4cf8-975a-0086894bcd0d	Light weight, variety of sizes are noticeably different from each other when worn in close proximity to each other, and has not tarnished on me yet.
5	c5d5120d-f7ec-4c70-b369-fafc769baf81	This 20&#34; chain was purchased as a replacement for an 18&#34; and a pendant which needed more than was originally supplied.  This has more of a white look to it but goes well with several of her pendants.<br /><br />The clasp is easy to use, this necklace was priced accordingly.  It is truly functional in all respects.
5	41fb1360-3ede-46a8-b948-027b65d85d70	Terrific unit.  I got it because I need to watch my blood sugar levels and couldn't find sugar free ice cream available.  Makes ice cream with custard like consistency, which I like.  I am using it nearly every night to make a make a ¼ - ½ batch which takes about 15 minutes.  Ingredients are fresh; clean-up couldn’t be easier.  Highly recommend!
1	1e2b21d0-3080-4a1a-85e6-156fe544fa1d	Too big and too heavy, but very beautiful for somebody who likes big accessories.....
3	b26437f1-b0a8-41f0-961f-fcf904777ed1	What can I say? It works.
5	14959050-7e73-49f7-ae2c-d735e2283134	Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone.
2	d969c35c-18f1-4828-b88a-2e405bc45a84	The one that I received is very pale.  It does not look like the one in the picture.  It is going back.
3	c111ab8e-5c3a-4049-af9a-52433a0382d7	too big
5	da219360-6bb4-4d22-b7e4-161a7f049c32	Awesome cups.
5	cc747645-a6e2-4274-82a8-37bd6b2118c9	I ordered this for my grandparents and they really love this product! Been using this for YEARS!
5	5dab3acc-53a7-4b1f-b9b6-7c225e941e8a	Very nice! It was a gift from my wife and it works great to hold all my rings and other keepsakes.  It looks sleek and clean and I enjoy it greatly.
5	05b7c747-06d8-44de-aa0b-6a2fa4ba2966	Just as described, great quality and arrived quickly. My son loves it.
4	db6bb954-35b5-4eee-9fb7-a8965723e756	Love  them
5	2b3197b9-2c6f-4cc8-9454-662f60125937	I love this muffin pan. I use it primarily for making low carb &#34;egg nests&#34;. They cook evenly and pop out perfectly!! I do have to use a baking sheet underneath the muffin pan since it is rather bendy.
4	1cc35b17-e079-4270-867e-2916d41379e5	It is nice if you believe in magnet therapy or want to try it out. Hold up well and easy to put on but it can be difficult to get off if you have arthritis in you hands.
1	b828b3f3-1b15-4cb7-9443-66ab1d8aee28	First of all the item was tiny...like a checker. Second when I got in the mail with out even taking it out of packing it was brown with the very cheap material. Not worth the amount of money sold for and sucked. My dad fixed it and it turned my neck red and gray. Do not buy this!
5	b6eff132-289d-4539-8f52-ef2cb45bebec	Hello. Its motor burned.Have you extra motor of this processor?
3	8b43d124-74b7-4829-b4f6-ae007397bac1	Item was a little bulkier than shown.
5	160332b3-5c1a-4aac-9659-bc77db1ff6fb	For the price, a bargain...my wife even loves the design of the setting.
5	5df1f6ef-92f6-4b51-90ef-c279c96ea2ca	This knife is incredible value for the money.  At $51, its about 40% less than I have seen this Honesuki elsewhere, and is far cheaper than a decent European style boning knife (which makes it an absurd value).  At this price, it deserves 5 stars.  Not the most exotic material, but fit and finish is quite nice, and I find the shape, as well as the uncommon heft for a Japanese blade, to be a very useful addition to my block.  I have been surprised at how many uses other than boning I have been able to put this knife to.  I have found myself using it to core tomatoes and other vegetables using the tip, and its heft and relevant non-delicacy makes it handy for cutting and pitting avocadoes.  The small, thin tipped, and rigid blade, also makes this the perfect shallot cutting tool.<br /><br />One small potential negative -- at least for me -- is that Tojiro prints its logo and &#34;Made in Japan&#34; in Latin characters on the bottom of the knife -- this is not shown in the pictures above, which I imagine is the version sold in Japan.  I might try to polish this stuff off.
5	f3a85ea5-2964-41cf-a64b-dd422125672c	Great product to replace plastic!
5	697d94f9-6f69-41e0-89aa-75e5c1743e2c	Calphalon is great stuff.  Very durable and easy to maintain.  The quality is top notch.  This set has everything for basic cooking tasks.  Could use a  medium bot for boiling pasta and a griddle but bought those as separates.  Make sure to order the Calphalon utensils too.
5	310c1eb8-ef1d-40a2-a398-02b904569419	Real nice
5	c2975b4a-7985-4c3b-b5b4-ba1b1d663bf3	Big enough for a bottl of water and a thermos for my sons lunch. Awesome!
5	481fff5b-df2e-4ede-8421-9f879f590fe4	Works as expected and we now enjoy popcorn made in a more healthy way.
3	7b0cebff-3262-47b6-883d-ccb8308b6199	It works. It's just kind of annoying to clean (lots of different parts and the base part gets junky but you have to be careful about washing it since it has the electronic components) and so I actually don't end up using it as much as I thought I would. I'm kind of lazy though. But I also bought it because I'm lazy and wanted an easy way to steam food and eat healthier. I'm not sure if I would buy it again. I would probably try one of the simple microwave steamers instead next time.
4	3e9ddd83-f041-402a-8004-e4a13231f43a	chain  is a little to small but It is pretty
5	c10ae581-c189-4fc3-8bf6-eeeff3caeef2	Came as expected. Stupid PC for discontinuing these items. Nothing beats them.
5	a7afda5c-17da-462e-81a0-c03ea3505d5c	Look exactly as pictured.  These earrings are well made and look very nice on.
5	eb7ab295-771a-42ca-bb4f-04fc7e2c7281	Gave this as a gift to a woman I am interested in, she like it said it was cute. Would recommend it.
2	7e3929d2-4eeb-4455-bc70-1721a945c8c3	This thing was a hassle.  Never did get it to work and taking it apart is a bit cumbersome as it's in multiple pieces.  It's in the cupboard and I bought a different chopper.
5	335fa192-bacc-4e13-b5b0-9988a855c08d	Excellent! I'm enjoying every day tasty filtered coffees with it!
3	06f0c166-b5c1-4477-bb4a-8b68e74889c6	Hard to remove the Icestar from the silicon.  I suppose that is to be expected.  Product works as designed.  Just not as fun as I hoped it would be.  Obviously this almost immediately melts into nothing more than an ice ball once you poor anything over it.  Lower expectations advised....
3	dd76474d-4482-4968-8083-bc334eca937d	They are smaller than appear, but are still ok.
5	343a6ae0-c7ba-4644-a341-1c3fcd64f623	Portion Control Plate TrimDish is so helpful for people who struggle with food proportions, dieting or just need help in learning to eat healthy and right. For me I have always had a problem in knowing correct portion sizes for different good groups, or I would just guess at it. This portion control plate takes the hard work and guessing out of it. It is clearly marked as to what a portion is, how many you need a day and what goes into each slot. This is very important now since my husband is a diabetic we are learning to closely watch food, this plate is so helpful and made it simple to follow the guidelines on meal preps. I place it on the plate and fill it up according to the lines marked on it.  There is a chart that comes on the paper it comes with I hung it on the fridge until I learn all the servings per day.<br />This plate would be perfect for those wanting to start a diet, those who are learning to measure foods, who are on restrictive diets as well. Like I said I always had problems in the past before this plate trying to measure foods, this is a one step set up, place it on your plate and fill to lines it is really fool proof even my daughters can use it. Healthy teachings start young around here.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
4	1fce9608-dc2e-4ba9-afd4-a02808833694	These are very pretty, but HUGE!!!!! I have them to my daughter.
5	b2f69b88-688e-4b79-8613-3ab14a71366d	love it
5	a1c9070a-ac85-44a2-97bc-4eead42cb6ed	The big cubes are a lot of fun.  Better for not diluting drink.
5	d8bcd12d-7e7e-4cb1-9232-029bc70b7953	Makes delicious, foamy, milk in just seconds! It's nice and small, but surprisingly powerful. It's also super easy to clean which is definitely a plus. All my hot drinks are now cafe quality!
4	9c058165-a836-466f-8a6c-bebe66dc1fd6	Works good! Solid cup
5	34f93315-1546-438b-b4e0-bb1ab2d78d3e	My son's birthstone is the Amethyst.  I bought this for me on a whim because the price was so great, and I am extremely happy that I did.  The color of the stones are a rich purple and the style is so cute that I find myself just staring at it when I wear it.
5	bc4d7ef9-f632-4f34-be2f-186d228f81b7	My daughter loves them.
5	370db80b-f734-418e-8df1-1dd4fb68c2d7	I like it, easy to use.
4	9432d780-4b21-431c-aaed-9d553daa267a	she loves these ear rings.
2	432237d6-085d-42d1-acb7-6311c9ab7259	Not as expected
4	9b480a8c-8787-4abc-819e-2b37cb91c8df	This is THE best buy. I use it at least 4x a week. It works for cold as well as hot. I wouldn't say it is Intant Read though. I hand my hand over a pan of hot oil for Felafel (Tori Avery's Recipe) and it sure could have read faster right then!
5	c314cb69-6c67-45eb-ad98-ae5df08542dd	Really surprised at this ring.  First off, it was elegantly packaged (like you'd expect from a high end seller) and out of the box it's gorgeous.<br /><br />Both the gold and tungsten black are shiny (not matte) and the fit (size 11) was perfect.  It has a hunky look to it, this is no dainty band!  It attracts attention much more with the gold in the middle than if the colors were reversed. We constantly get asked where we got it...it really draws attention and adds a modern edge for men that don't feel comfortable with &#34;jewelry&#34;. Right now my husband is wearing this on his wedding ring finger, and another one (tungsten with gold celtic carvings in the middle). This is a guy that hates wearing a watch because it feels like too much jewelry..<br /><br />Now here's the kicker: he swims in a chlorinated pool daily.  DAILY. He works in the yard and does dishes (not as often as I'd like, but you know).  The older one he has looks just as great as the newer one. Still glossy, still smooth. It's so well-beveled that when you cross the band with a fingertip you cannot feel the seam between materials.  Both rings are great, but this BLACK with gold is definitely an attention getter, and the heft of the 8mm width looks good on a bigger guy (he's 6'3&#34; and his old wedding ring looked too thin).<br /><br />Very pleased with the seller and the product.<br /><br />I rec'd this as a sample to review and inspect.
4	0bf2423a-73bf-4ae7-a9bb-45ce38ff5812	Great board.
5	bb21c370-e2f4-4b6f-837d-c8568bbdb28c	Item just as described.  Just what I was looking for.  My Granddaughter just loves this cup.  It is the only one she will use.  The cup works great. Very satisfied.  Great doing business with !!  Thanks !!  A+++++
5	60d0a21a-dfc5-47ad-b367-8dab16ee71ce	Being able to set the exact temperature makes a major difference with coffee and tea. Most variable temperature kettles only provide several temperature settings -- hardly enough for all the different kinds of brew methods as well types of coffee beans/tea leaves. A five degree difference, for example, can make big impact in taste.<br /><br />As for the complaints about rust, I've had my Bonavita for 8 months without any problems. Stainless steel will stain and even rust if it comes into contact with an abrasive cleaner (such as any spray cleaner with bleach) -- which people are likely to be using in their kitchens. If it happens to you just clean it with Bar Keepers Friend. That will clear it up in a few seconds.
5	7e94547c-8fdd-4b2a-a766-05d0a2d55762	If you are looking for a bread machine, don't look any further. Buy this one! The first time I used it, the loaf came out perfectly. I used home made settings and all subsequent loaves are just as wonderful. I will never bake bread in the oven as long as I have this machine.
5	2965f79e-7792-49f3-b087-d474f3b86cd9	This is above and beyond my expectations for such in-expensive jewelry.  The fit is PERFECT. And it's not to long like most jewelry I find on here.  Freaking rad find.
5	dfe42688-ff89-4cf9-86fb-04d938e3c411	I feel sorry for a friend of mine who just paid $100 for a wine bottle opener that probably doesn't even work as well as this Peak Reserve Premium Wine Opener Corkscrew.  I've never had a wine bottle opener that was so easy to use.  It lines up perfectly with the cork, and you don't even have to turn the corkscrew, just press down on the lever.  It may look complicated, but it's so easy to use it doesn't even come with directions.<br /><br />Before applying the wine bottle opener, clasp the accompanying foil cutter around the top of your wine bottle and give it a turn.  It cuts the foil neatly off of the bottle top. My husband always got so grumpy when I used a knife to remove the foil, and I'd be the first to admit it dulls the knife blade. Now he won't have to sharpen our knives nearly as often.<br /><br />Both the opener and the foil cutter come in a nice presentation box.  I just wish my friend had known about this product before she purchased her hundred dollar opener.<br /><br />***product supplied by vendor for testing and review***
5	591a6852-b005-482f-9670-68a2a4a10323	Wish I had one of these years ago!  Works great on pots/pans with my bamboo steamer...
5	eebb7b1e-f73f-45dd-9b6c-6dbb486c0598	Great Look! Fits well!
3	12c595a1-edf3-4f36-b948-c0cae0596b23	I would love to review this pot but so far I have not been able to use it! I am sure it will work as well as the other Calphalon pots I own. Those came in a Calphalon box and were ready to go when I unpacked them. THIS pot, which cost twice as much as the larger pots, came loose in a box with other items with bubble wrap taped to the bottom of the pot. The tape was SO sticky that it took me 30 minutes to get the tape off and then the residue that was left is STILL sticky! I have tried alcohol, oil, laundry spray Nail Polish remover... all sort of things that people have suggested but the sticky residue remains! So a week later I have yet to use the pot! This residue is on the bottom of the pot so I am reluctant  to put it on a burner. This packaging is annoying to say the least! I will keep scrubbing and hope I can get the rest of the residue off soon!
5	89b971c7-d07f-406e-b472-3cc0590b1663	VERY COOL, FANTASTIC TO USE.JUST WANT WE WANT.
4	ebec61d1-cba6-48a3-a0e4-168b9dd09171	Delivery was good towards the long way to Korea but unfortunately I wanted a smaller, handy knife. It was my mistake that I didn't check the actual size from the search list.
4	8965d009-6717-4c92-901a-fd5d656ee687	Elegant/Classy for my look I'm going for .
4	ab3fc1de-5bc6-4e4f-be7d-36f45d84b96c	Most charms are very cute and well priced.  A few looked a little cheap.
5	7a3af684-a8aa-4e93-bd45-d4056600963e	very amazing necklace! I didn't expect it to be as beautiful as it is! The rope chain is really durable and pretty too :) Shipping was pretty fast also
5	f5d49fe9-468d-4211-961a-42042b0ff833	Excellent. Perfect size and very soothing for my feet.
5	b9d4fcef-2ffa-48c5-8c51-cc9bf276e6c8	I can now make my faux ice cream and eat it too! This thing is amazing. I read some reviews that it was loud so I wasn't sure what to expect but it was not bad at all. It was simple to use and easy to clean. It turned the bananas and strawberries into a wonderful creamy texture that was totally yummy!
5	1ebc40af-ccef-47b6-83a8-544b4c4d1175	Very affordable way to can food. Love it.
5	14e5c2cf-54b1-4311-a38f-5e1d56af2100	I love this skull necklace! I bought in the silver tone, very fast shipping (thank you for that!). Feels really good on my neck, and is so very sparkly! Wow! Would love one in silver tone with all black sparkly stones! Would love one of the small skulls as earrings. Will look for that! Thank you very much for such a fun pretty sparkly necklace!
5	4476aa7f-d1b8-4b06-93aa-95e3e74def2e	Item was more beautiful in person than online.  Super-fast shipping, great quality.
5	56ba7404-f89f-471b-a0c8-5fd4ed051f14	I love the color so much
3	a1b18d88-b0e4-4bff-b087-c8dc57b4e3c7	The piece broke off after a couple of months but i loved it while it lasted
5	3f2d4b84-0bf9-4a60-b0ad-65b59cbb882e	Awesome
1	6320a83f-b78a-4b20-a849-107aaead0ce3	Tried to open bottle and plastic cover was so hard to pull off, we spilled 1/2 the bottle.
5	41268ad8-a37f-4d2e-94a1-090d8293d44b	Bought it for my mother.  She uses it everyday and loves it.  The water is boiling before the toast is ready.
3	c2e07dcd-5ecc-4b97-9272-eadf5a134d82	These are as expected.  Plain silver heart earrings.  They seem to be a little bent to me already though, after one wearing.  For the price perhaps its expected.
3	602f9ae8-8744-4c5e-a171-15135a5a9e23	Measurement should be included in the add, also price should be included on packing slip. Pendent is a LOT smaller than pictured.
5	026fa66e-c675-4290-adf5-7a0168a6fc27	Been looking for this size boll from Pyrex. Had one for years and broke it was never able to find a replacement until now. Perfect for large salads, making bread and love the lid. The other one I had didn't come with a lid. Wish now I had bought the set.
5	f3a31919-405e-4d84-9cee-06bc8e467e08	I've had it for a few days now and I can say that I'm VERY impressed. I've bought some necklaces and chains from Amazon in the past and they weren't really up to par when I got them, however this came as a pleasant surprise. The cross is absolutely gorgeous and a nice size and heavy, and the chain is pretty strong as well. I've worn it in the shower and to the gym and everything is holding up so far. Could not be more pleased, especially with the low price of the necklace. Definitely recommend this over those other pendant necklaces on Amazon that are $10 and cheap as hell.
4	4520b6ba-fac6-4336-84d2-108679727a7c	Look very nice.I got these for my wife's birthday in August.I hope she likes them.

5	117dcb88-39ad-47f3-8d72-0076a10e0185	Good working so far
5	8505db07-f8e3-499b-bbae-ac8061a8b050	I like being able to sharpen knives from different parts of the world. So far I have sharp knives with no damage to the blades.
5	4aa1239d-451f-42a2-b77b-279fdfcc8d1f	verry good!!! product!!! wonderful!!!!
5	9bbae64f-af9b-46c4-a41f-f69d29c2a3fb	I am in love with these plugs just the right amount of watch parts for each plug! Fit and finish on these plugs are also top notch! I would highly recommend these plugs for anyone looking for something unique!
5	a4d2a749-6348-4526-88c3-83cb165d2b72	I've only used this for iced coffee a few times, but it seems to be a great quality. Now if I can just my coffee measurements right...
5	2dd5246d-bd4c-4064-9267-01c5d9b22ddc	Grandson loves it.
4	16a53695-4055-47af-8618-8775903c6a59	very nice to wear on each side of your center ring
5	9c647469-d8b1-4af3-8e70-7f5dc7718acc	Absolutely love it - I bought a few of them in different colours. Fits perfectly. I sometimes wear it alone or stacked with others from the collection. Would buy from them again.
5	d4b67fbf-f154-4b51-96d8-2f9a6d8791ae	They work OK, but are qu
5	7028f0bf-0441-444d-9afe-1acd7227640f	works great
2	798e945a-da68-4a15-bba3-eb336a6a530a	The inner slots don't brown to the same level of &#34;doneness&#34; as the companion outer slots, so you can't efficiently toast four pieces at the same time. You have to retoast the inner slices. Functions more like a 2 slot toaster. Not pleased.
5	a1e8f307-4f00-4a36-84b1-dc66c995ffa1	I love being able to brew a carafe of coffee in my keurig.  Also, this is much more quiet than my old keurig elite brewer. It has more brewing options, it holds more water in the reservoir, and the auto-on is great. A year ago I read reviews from people that not all k-cups were compatible with the 2.0, but now they all are as far as I know.  Thanks keurig for the free pods for writing a review.  I love my new K450 brewer!
5	2e4fccfe-996c-41ee-bb9b-dd79df15f743	I love this Bar Drinking Glass with Multi-Colored Flashing LED Lights! It's seriously awesome to use at parties, at your own house, or even just drinking alone. Definitely helps if you're in a darker area - think outside just hanging out. It'd actually be an ideal cup to have, since it does light up. It can flash, blink, or just stay solid when turned on. I usually use the solid color setting. It's really fun, too, since it'll change the colour of whatever drink you're having. I wasn't expecting the three different settings, so that was a nice surprise. Sometimes too many blinking or flashing lights give me a headache, and I can't handle it, so I appreciate the thoughtfulness of three different lighting options. I plan on buying a few more, especially for such a great price, and giving them to some of my 21+ friends who would enjoy having a cup like this, especially for holidays (New Years) or whenever we're all getting together for a small party. I seriously love this cup, even if it was a bit smaller than I had hoped and expected.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.
1	c22b7e20-cb94-4466-8c2b-cfff0d4030c8	do not buy got it yesterday returning it gets EXTREMELY extrmely Hot HOT dangerous to even open the door my hands are still burning typing this to you and the smell like fire and it blew  my circuit in the kitchen scared that its gonna start a fire
2	d4faf669-b23c-4e0d-9c7a-ac8acbe4bf60	Pretty necklace and cheap too, but the quality is quite low.
4	0bb75cac-c31b-46da-97e4-e03e7b525f05	I previously wrote a review about 7 months ago... Gave my girl one (now ex) and bought me one (still wear it). Rings are still going strong for such a low price. I love the ring. Only down side is the black fades a little after a while, but I'm hard on rings.
4	e3ff2635-1bf2-4543-af88-efd0917190df	It arrived promptly. I am pleased with the French coffee press. I have used them for  nearly twenty years.
3	f696bc62-e8fc-4ebe-936d-2de1e073fca2	The letters slide around and the rest of the band that is left over after fastening it sticks up.  I love it but these 2 things make it disfunctional. My boyfriend loves it and so do I but is it possible for those things to be fixed??
5	f7138f8b-8cce-4a34-8fb8-cdfb39758dd1	Very pleased. Just as described. Packaging was great.
5	599a6308-0e99-483c-b0da-7c46aa9909df	Nice product. Good  purchase.
2	e55c2506-4a1f-49f4-9927-548a896933a0	chain broke after one week. the dolphin design though is nice. the blue is a lot darker than the picture suggests.
5	c5ffe110-8d0f-4984-add7-0796b1a4f2cd	My wife was pleased with this addition to her Pandora Charm Bracelet.  She said it had just the right amount of bling, making me a happy hubby. 😎
5	6fb8d175-1717-4ba6-9120-b938e7c8c07f	Smaller than expected, but still holds a lot. I had a large bamboo utensil holder, but it was getting too full so I used this one to put whisks and rubber spatulas in. Has a great look and nice quality.<br /><br />Reviewer was given a discounted product in exchange for an honest review.
4	575e1d11-5de3-4b3c-b8ad-a774477e487b	It looks good
3	8ea48b6c-4534-496b-8168-bf0ba35eaf63	It arrived on time and looks amazing HOWEVER I didn't even have it out of the packaging and one of the stones had already poped off. Still good just have to fix that one &#34;stone&#34;
1	4594c348-a50a-4e0a-ac9a-9f16fb172f86	This toaster barely toasted on one side and burnt the other side!  I tried several settings, but the same thing happened each time, not toasted and one side and BURNT on the other.  Returned it right away; this toaster simply does not work well.
4	37279c15-958b-40e5-a472-f549f2e0a4d4	SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT LOOKS GOOD . I LIKE THE STORAGE SPACES
4	cc03c764-452e-4ce5-b992-383da2e9fdff	Very Nice Piece have it on today
3	6d00cda5-9940-477e-8091-d826074acb49	Yes, I like it. I found I gave earrings and a bracelet to match.
5	f9385319-a4e8-4da3-b657-cf0c7b282aa6	No really a bid review fan, but this ring is very nice. The details are in fact very impressive. It is a ring for guy who want to show his character. I wear it on my right hand and every time I saw this ring while driving and writing. It gives your the spirit and courage to carry on and tell people that you are different. A good buy.
5	4352dfd1-d914-4f3b-ae6b-0676203bb3ad	These are fantastic cord ends.  Can hammer them to make them square - great antiqued look.
5	c8b655e6-0da5-4a9b-a3ae-174a8388869c	My dish is very nice.
5	49996c3a-0bd2-4bb0-8bda-d326ec3f5ff3	yes! Thank you. Works awesome.
2	6a737e89-b273-454e-bd8a-07dce5dc36e2	Very cute earrings, stylish too, the clasp for the earring is hard to open to take the earrings off. (back of earring) If you don't close it hard enough, the earring won't close at all. A bit too complicated for a pair of earrings. They definitely need to work on the clasp and make it simple for customers just like any other earrings.
5	2e6718e2-84ef-405f-8030-f1682aa925a4	Great product. Have used it 5 days in a row since I got it! Washes up easily and stores in a drawer.<br />Very reasonable price for a product you will use often.
3	210f7ac5-fddc-44dc-ad4c-c2b2a6e413c3	I think this is the same as any other cheap lunchbox. The compartments didn't keep my food hot/cold. I like the idea but the tops didn't fit very well either so I worried about food spilling out.
1	72fae4c5-ea0d-4778-a994-9d2bd8f4f39a	it is made to look like a high top to hold a full pound of butter and it only holds two 1/4 pound sticks
1	abdf51d7-ea83-46e6-8756-69a84669f2bf	Junk, heating elements warp and crack and split.
5	0e2e80e6-5b4d-40a3-b455-628c57faf2d1	Very nice and I really like it.  Reminds me always to pray.  Trying to find a similar in gold or gold plated.
5	47e17d4e-89c5-4b37-ab67-5fb3c05ac95b	Bought for my mother for Mother's Day and she loves it!
5	5afb3ee2-0f6f-4f57-ae82-03df13f534a4	Meal Prep Haven's 2 Compartment Food Containers are like upscale restaurant to go containers on steroids because they're much more durable and hold up to being used over and over again.  My kids don't particularly like cold sandwiches for lunch day after day, so these will work out well as their school lunch containers.<br /><br />In fact, these sturdy BPA free containers and freezer, microwave, and dishwasher safe, so I'm going to use some of the recipes from one of my favorite books, &#34;Don't Panic, Dinner's in the Freezer&#34;, to make meals in advance and freeze them in these containers to use as needed!  It'll be perfect because the food will thaw as they wait for their lunch hour, then they can microwave it in the cafeteria's microwave and enjoy a hot home made lunch rather than having to eat the &#34;food&#34; they serve at school these days.<br /><br />These food containers would also be perfect for folks on a diet because they could prepare their meals ahead as well as manage their portion size. One of my neighbors is on the Paleo Diet Plan and swears by this book, &#34;Paleo Meal Plan: A Complete 7 Day Paleo Meal Planner with Full Shopping List&#34;.  Of course you don't need to be on a diet to find these food containers useful. They're just as handy to use to put your leftovers away, or take a meal to work with, or to the gym, to take on road trips, or a zillion other uses.<br /><br />They're well made and can stand up to getting bumped, dropped, microwaved, frozen, cleaned in the dishwasher, and stacked when not needed.  The company backs them up with a lifetime guarantee as well, so there's nothing to lose by trying them.<br /><br />Promotional discount provided for product evaluation, testing, and review purposes.
5	9e3ca009-071d-447f-ad52-28d2519b0eae	My daughter loves it.  The only thing is, you cannot adjust it.  Otherwise, it is very nice.
1	44f993e3-7875-49ec-a67c-9f317de9af04	After wearing the earrings twice they broke<br />Very fragile
5	a3708e1e-f65f-426b-8169-ad33bfd0d746	I think this necklace is very pretty. Made well. Great quality for the money. Makes a great gift.
5	04a29344-768b-4cd0-8d71-0ac8429350ef	Necklace arrived in a cute little pouch. Simple and sparkly and very lightweight. Great gift for any soccer fan.
2	f6823879-ef7d-40e0-8d90-a58b8a4df1f1	Too rigid to &#34;fit&#34; to toe.  Would not order it again.
1	19c8ac1c-5c5b-4933-8cfa-b341752df5d3	It was very pretty but very disappointing of it . It was no direction`s and i had to hold  it all together with good ole scotch tape ..Even tho the people that took picture`s were like &#34; WHAT &#34; ?????
1	0b6dadee-05de-4236-940c-662eab954167	They are advertised as being 3/4 inch wide.  The ones I received are a full 1 inch wide.  Definitely not as advertised.  Disappointed.
5	5d050c2d-27f0-4fdc-93d1-48922d2d4f74	This ring is sooo sweet!! I'm going to give it as a Christmas present to my granddaughter. She just turned 9 & it's just the right size for her. I think she can wear it on her index finger & it's purple so what not to love about it!
1	8c5790c9-96ad-4fb4-a3e3-c36c7b1b96ba	poor quality.
4	08c40e99-0747-4e57-8617-3c5eb7b18b99	Does it Job
4	6f49668a-0054-4e8f-ab3a-64439a1f61c3	This cup is nice as it is ceramic and also  has a nice tight lid for spills.  The only thing is that it came with a large sticker on it that did not come off all the way when I washed it.  I had to scrub the sticky glue off with alcohol.  Other than that, it's a very nice large cup.
5	fbf59ba6-f5a9-4f16-9b9d-e80f59cbb638	Was surprised by the look of the earrings.
5	6bb1bc0f-9fc6-4a86-855a-916da7caf609	The item was just as described.
4	bde7c2fc-215d-4b2c-89fe-9005948d4a22	Works great
5	c38705a3-39b2-4d0a-bfcf-f60385d34f87	Love this necklace, very pretty in person. The pendant was a little curled, but I just bent it back with no issues. No heavy and very well made. I woild not hesitate to buy the other colors.
5	96925511-fc87-44ff-b20d-6c346941e771	Bought this in March 2014..<br />Price-$25.50.<br />Very good toaster.
5	526ba8af-c676-4e08-b3cd-5dbbeab20857	Just got my ring way before the shipping date and once again I am happy happy happy! The ring is gorgeous stainless steel the spinner chain center is a nice touch and the ring feels great on my finger. The ring could be a little bit thicker but I have large fingers so it's not really that big a deal. Definitely a quality buy for a cheap price. Great gift for the man in your life.
4	45e3efe3-a897-47ce-99e5-5cd21b1de5fb	So these are nice quality picks.  The balls are made of wood and are painted nicely like tennis balls.  I was able to make sandwich roll-ups using deli meats and cheeses which I sliced to look like pinwheels.  Each pick held two pinwheels, but could have easily held 3 pinwheels, if I had tried.<br /><br />For only getting 100 picks, these are pricey at nearly twelve dollars.  Of course finding tennis themed items is not that easy, and they fit the event for which I made the mentioned sandwich pinwheels, so that is a positive.<br /><br />Overall, I most likely won't buy more at this price, but would at a lower price point.
5	1935117a-2e62-4e3c-b5b4-8e0beebb164d	Great product
5	a50f39b3-72bf-4519-aec5-f78e8190709d	Nice, as expected.
4	bd723a85-4be6-45f3-9440-619484ac9c65	Perfect so dainty. I love it.
5	3ae70eb9-0774-40b1-9896-efe1405b9bbd	I purchased this charm as a gift for my wife who loves Pandora bracelets AND Snow White, so...perfect gift!.  She really likes it, and it's definitely genuine Pandora quality.
3	e3a851a9-344c-4d5e-9e44-67bc42202368	i cannot remember when I ordered this product but I also purchased the filters for the Keurig as well,,,, of course I used them almost immediately to descale the machine and it worked very well,,,, I will most likely continue to use this from time to time to keep the machine in tip - top shape because I love my coffee !<br />thanks so much !
4	0927e9f5-55cd-4576-9e06-f82316f29ef8	Good measuring cup, but not as nice and the now-discontinued Anchor Hocking 2-Cup Triple Pour, which had raised numbers and Lise in the glass to indicate the measurements. This will do, although I anticipate that the red markings will fade over time as the cup is warned in the dishwasher.
5	4d2ad29f-964c-47a4-b0ea-9b9d445319bb	I received this in a few days and am very pleased with my purchase. It is a beautiful necklace and earring set for the price.
5	0b8ea5a9-90c1-4b98-ac56-e26c66b6d1fe	SPARKLE! A fantastic value. Arrived fast. The vale fits my chain perfect. Perfect special gift for someone special or yourself. :-) I am so glad I purchased this for myself for my birthday!
1	95bbbdd2-737c-4f52-8d56-017addd957df	Even though a nice quality piece of steel, I ordered it because it does not have grooves.  Guess what, they lied.  the measurements are grooved.<br />Since I don't want to go through the hassles of returning it, I will use it and hope it does not mar my coin rings.
2	331d4115-e16f-469e-93c9-281b77207103	Part of chain broke easily when I tried unhooking it
5	9a0a47d3-7e3d-4826-813b-c58ce6434a50	Not too large or flashy. Easy to put in.
4	3b209176-6f14-43f8-b9fd-c4ae5d01259e	Good
5	ce601477-4b2e-45f5-afed-42f9618c7eab	I have had this for a few months.  I love it.  It is a great salad spinner.  The spinning is manual but very easy.  You need to stabalize the bowl with one hand as you spin using the other.  But 4 or 5 turns will do it for a head of romaine.  It cleans easily and I hav put it in the dishwasher more than once.<br /><br />It consists of 3 pieces, the cover, the baswket and the cup.  It is large, but we use it for fruit as well as lettuce and don't have storage issues.
5	cd87f853-45e5-446a-bea1-9c1b6f31e8f4	Nice gift for someone starting out on their own. We bought it for our son & he says it's great! Thank you again Amazon!
5	15043531-5a60-4806-83c6-89ca412b8d13	Really cute. A classy way to support your baseball/softball player. Much smaller than I anticipated but, still very cute on a chain.
5	ed08b75a-a63a-4fe9-84da-8e8ecbbd9f63	Was given as an prize
5	ec479c88-9ee8-492a-9252-b23a1590bea5	Good qualit. Sturdy  and makes great coffee! I'll be saving myself about $25 a wk!
5	ac220087-0bad-45c8-91b6-770e0c5fad82	The first one was with no lid but the second one is exactly what I needed keeps coffee nice and fresh
5	5848f698-2410-4dea-88c9-6d891d9aaa22	I purchased two of these Vintage Silver Infinite Bracelets.  One for my daughter and one for my niece.  They shipped from China, so they did take a while to arrive, however, they were in good condition.  They were wrapped individually in a clear plastic wrapper and were well made.  My daughter spilled something on her bracelet and decided to soak it in soapy water for a couple days (without telling me) and when I found it, all the metal was rusted, so I would suggest not showering with it on.  Each piece is separated on the top, but are all connected to one large piece underneath.  The clasp is easy to use, even if you have to clasp it by yourself.  I would recommend these bracelets to friends and family.
5	1db92d1d-a1c3-41c3-8592-d0c2f8205422	Love this blender. Arrived on time.
5	5e503b51-56a0-4841-aef7-8463ec416133	Along with my previous order, this black princess ring was my friend's choice for her boyfriend. It's not wrong to give a guy a ring, it seems awkward I know. But once my friend saw this ring, she was totally in love with the design. It doesn't mean that this ring is only for engagement or wedding ring purposes. It is also perfect as birthday gifts for boyfriend, husband or even for dad's. <br /><br />Because this ring is impressively beautiful, guys will definitely appreciate your effort. And that's really the case when my friend gave this ring to her boyfriend. My friend came in so dramatically emotional the last time she visited and thanked me. <br /><br />And then I ask my friend before I batched post a review on our purchase. <br /><br />Here's her reply....<br /><br />The stones came out so brightly on day time when the sun shines on it. Her boyfriend wears the ring most of the time aside from going to work. His fingers looks so nice especially when driving and out for a date. The fitting was a little smaller, because we just guess her boyfriend finger size. She wanted to turn it back and request for a change, but her boyfriend insisted that he can't wait for another days to wear it. My friend wanted the ring for her boyfriend's middle finger. Unfortunately, the ring only fits her boyfriend's ring finger. Anyway, they were both happy with that.<br /><br />There were no trace of scratches and damage. Smooth all over the frame and no harsh edges. Her boyfriend's comment...&#34;This ring is absolutely perfect for men who loves fashion wear.&#34;<br /><br />My friend was happy also for the very affordable price she got for a very nice men's ring.
5	93f33e40-29ac-4088-b809-2ffe85dd1062	The knife has a very sharp blade out of the box. I just received it so I can't say how long it will hold the edge. Well balanced and it sliced a ham with no tearing on thin slices. Very fast shipping!
5	6ab0e074-45a5-4790-a017-85618082fa2c	This is a great spray bottle.  It came packaged in bubble wrap with no scratches.  It is a dark amber color to filter out the light & glass so no leaching.  This is especially important if you put anything citrusy in it.  I love the sprayer on this - it covers a very wide surface area.  This is perfect for homemade bug spray.  The cap fits on tight so no worries about it leaking anywhere.<br />My bug spray recipe in case anyone wants to try it is: (this is for this 2 oz size)<br />Fill bottle 2/3 way with distilled water.  Then the remaining 1/3 with witch hazel.  (witch hazel will act as an emulsifier) .  Then I add about 10-12 drops of essential oils - I use Purification as the majority & then add in some others depending on what I have but these are all great bug deterrents:  Purification (my favorite), Citronella, Lemongrass, Peppermint (ants/bees really hate this one so I also make an ant/bee spray that I spray around my house), Lavender, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Patchouli, & Geranium.<br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.
4	78cda693-2494-4111-8b79-9b381cc7aa21	Got this for my senior ball. Absolutely love it! It looked fantastic, earned compliments, was comfy (no irritating metals) and hasn't fallen apart or broken and I STILL wear it all the time :)
5	16194779-19a0-41d9-a770-43228a032449	Order arrived quickly; product was as described.
5	22ef857b-fcad-4ad8-ab40-925d21ca073b	Best product and fast shipment
5	17c5f4ec-bd21-49fe-b764-5f247b8f92c6	I purhcased this through another vendor and it is incredible!!  Many years ago I travelled to Italy and had their version of pizza and it was incredible! I made a thin crust dough and rolled it out very thin and within 4 minutes had the 2nd best pizza I have ever had in my life! (olive oil and thinly sliced bacon!!)....Not as great as Italy, but by far 2nd best!!! This was my first pizza so i will keep you posted as time goes by....<br /><br />it is bigger than I thought but WHO CARES!!
5	3e241866-942b-4a76-8896-12dec938373d	Small but nice
3	cff73259-edc5-4390-9ea5-102d38f12e24	Use for party tray is the best use; not ideal for everyday use - needs to be longer!
