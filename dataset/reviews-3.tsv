860a585a-7df5-484c-8331-2d2f57f11948	5	Bought these for use with essential oils and my husband and I end up using them most every day in our kitchen.  They are very thick glass and the standard pyrex quality
09d08220-7f1b-43f5-ab9c-9d70333bd831	5	Awesome ring.
b2802cae-3ff9-461b-9fe1-546b5287ae15	2	Not what I was expecting.. and way smaller
9455018c-a41c-4d57-8f52-6672e23fd879	5	Bought this for my dad who likes &#34;old school&#34; nut grinding machine. He said he loves it!
cfc66795-e9e3-4fa3-b59e-ad90bb113719	2	I gave these as a gift.  The glasses themselves were fine.<br />We found out they are PAINTED red, and the color scratches off.<br />I am still looking for &#34;true red&#34; glasses.
d2d88575-d803-4df9-9c7a-f581c343bac8	5	These bags are wonderful!  They are great for freezing produce from my garden.
a2364dad-c4a9-4740-b033-575ac28ca327	1	I've had this scale for about 6 months and it's already acting up. If I sit it on the counter to use the numbers go crazy. I can't get it to zero out anymore which renders the Tare function useless. I get negative read offs or sometimes not even a set number. One item will send the scale crazy. I've tried changing the batteries out or leaving the scale alone to let it adjust and it just continues to flash tons of numbers. Not sure what happened because this thing gets stored safely in a cabinet in the box. Going to have to shop around for a more accurate functioning scale.
4918d18b-2c32-45e6-947e-04328d1fc016	5	They are awesome !!!! The gift is loved!
ddd7c9cc-7099-407a-9de3-8123b5b38062	4	These are great scissors and they feel like they are well made.  My one word of caution is these scissors come about, which is stated in the description, but they come apart very easily.  I took them out of the box when they arrived and while opening them up to help my husband open a second amazon box, they came apart and on side fell to the ground nearly missing my foot.  I like the fact the scissors come apart, but it should require a bit more effort.  I would like see some sort of safety to prevent unintentional separations.  This is the reason I took one star away.  With that in mid these are still great scissors, but I am much more careful when using them now and I try not to open them too wide to prevent them from coming apart while using.  I haven't had any issues since the first day now that I am aware of how they work.  The blades of the scissor are sharp and the handles feel good while using them.  The scissors come in a very nice looking, easy to open box with a plastic tray designed to hold the scissors.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
4c634bc8-98fb-4690-9220-c4896e5458f5	4	Pretty
ec6f0f08-abda-4974-95a7-9da0fdbd0e42	5	Very happy with this product.
b56b07dc-968c-41f1-bb5f-9d57a236f949	1	What I received was not as pictured and three bells had brown off of the chain.  The only reason there is a star is because one is required to post this.
de68a76f-a65d-4daf-a37c-ad5db06b2667	3	This is more of a barrette than a hairpin. I did not expect its profile to be so high; it is hard to wear it as in the photo because the feather itself sticks up quite far due to the barrette fixture below it. I would recommend only wearing it at the back of the head, rather than as a hairpin that would hold hair on the side.
4ed81c48-aec4-4ba8-8ddd-5e36e040e7e0	4	Works well, must slide slow or top will pop off
77633fc9-ca35-4113-b334-42930f3baa32	5	Works great and the popcorn kernels are fluffy, we do find white corn is more crispy than the yellow (softer & chewy).
b4be6022-72de-469a-9793-90100d06dbc0	5	It works great on my Nuwave plate with my older pans!
44b4a847-a128-4e20-9d1e-c32a369276f4	5	Heavy weight and high quality! Gorgeous blue crystals, I wish I had bought several pairs for sisters!
fb63019e-8753-40f5-890e-bab67949fd03	2	It broke one week after I received it.
c5263109-1501-4963-82e9-05bfdf0b1f80	1	Got these for my daughters. They are very thick and would not fit in their ears. They wiping not even fit in my ears and they have been pierced for over about 30 years.
3066c74e-a9f1-4e3a-af08-d6a06b65fbef	5	Good
de9f055f-56ba-47c6-9632-6a0d2f41c3fe	5	love it
abb062e5-a118-40a1-af4b-70ac42525033	5	Outstanding, cook everybody's breakfast at once.
6d9f9d48-8984-4594-8357-f256903c1d24	1	One came broken, planned to Krazy glue it back together.  Shortly after,  the stones in the other fell out also.  Never got to wear them. You get what you pay for I guess.
30d0579d-7d1e-4420-b4af-7820f26d07e7	4	This is the same ring that jewelry stores sell for $399! Great price!!! It's very bulky though
12687240-b315-42a5-8797-12ddd5800cd0	1	the ring broke in first use
ae51fb44-156a-4ed2-8b4d-88da1acf1f2b	1	I received a discounted item to provide feedback based upon my experiences with the product.  My husband wanted a manual coffee grinder for small batches of freshly ground coffee. I liked the fact that the base of this coffee grinder was made of glass. It was the perfect size for small batches. Once filled, it didn't take long to get the desired amount of coffee beans ground.  This grinder did not come with instructions, so it took us a minute or two to figure out that you needed to completely disassemble the unit to be able to fill it with coffee beans. It's easy to adjust the grind with the coffee with just a twist of the screw on top.  Unfortunately, the screw that the handle attaches to bent after the first use. The bend in the screw caused the plastic top to rub against the screw, and we ended up with metal shavings in the grinder and ground coffee. We didn't catch this until we had already put the grinds in the french press and disassembled the unit to add more beans for grinding.  Given our experience with the grinder, I can not recommend this grinder and will be sending it back.
605c2638-f159-462b-a3fc-6ad1d93920cb	5	Very nice part of the set I was able to complete (pendant and ring). I like the materials (amber and sterling silver) as well as craftsmanship.
00e8b63e-a6f5-4fa5-a05b-b2e91e9c8ea5	5	love them all
f7de7d41-ce58-45f6-b283-0a5047de7667	5	This is the best timer ever.
64600f8e-784b-4833-9b3d-df8ad9059b00	5	These were a total hit. Possibly my favorite of all the decorations.
80044598-caf1-4e2d-bca6-7d5472ae03ca	5	Very happy with these! Shipping was extremely fast! Got them 2 days early! :D<br /><br />They seem to be of very high quality. They don't bend easily like other cheap tunnels.<br /><br />I wish they would have come in individual bags, but it's not very hard to put them in order by the size!<br /><br />I can't wait to finally get to an inch!<br /><br />I will definitely be buying from this company again.
324c3799-75ea-49a0-a0b5-61a1a67f5d1b	5	Received our new Keurig and it works like a charm. Especially love the settings of being able to select different ounces to brew. Added plus: the strong option-to brew your coffee even stronger. It's an amazing machine and brews the perfect cup of coffee! It also has customization settings so you can set it for auto off in 15 minutes and it will shut down automatically. You can also brew a whole carafe and save the time of making individual cups.The coffee always tastes great and in the minimal amount of time -all in all the best coffee maker around! The vintage red is gorgeous and really pops in our kitchen. Thanks Keurig for the free pods for this review!
d154587e-e185-4f22-b299-6c92dc3f29c2	5	I'm 5'0&#34; and 95lbs, therefore I have small wrists so I was worried about how it would fit, if it would be loose, etc. it fits perfectly with a little room to spare, but hey, circulation :) would buy again
1f7dcbd0-631f-49af-aae5-9d902119b652	5	Excellent quality! Heavy ring, fit perfectly.
b0e2fa0c-e1a8-4f46-91a3-e178bc338ae9	5	Perfect for my daughter's performance.  Could be seen easily from the stage.
903d0d47-9ee1-465e-a882-9896b58d4b53	5	Just love these two slicers.....use everyday....girlfriend loved them so ordered a set for her.  Love they store locked....you don't have to worry about Cutting yourself....
5ad05cb0-4750-4a59-a743-9ba1e86deac6	5	Love this machine!  No more frozen tubs to worry about or find.
27e1d531-071f-4cdf-b09e-a1a7201f7c83	5	Very sturdy you could almost use these to hit someone you don't like. This will cut shortening all day no problem.
e3b7788d-1ffe-4f3d-8261-61c1e634cd6e	1	Pretty picture but they look cheap because of the material they are made of.
fba382f6-92e8-4d83-b192-d8bb1d43db97	5	Simple chain, good price.
863f5a5d-b8d4-412c-9f56-9354d3fc4ac3	4	Since they banned plastic bags from our island, we have nothing to line our smaller garbage cans with, nor do I have anything to scoop the kitty litter droppings into. These are perfect for all of that. The only thing I would change is perhaps make them a little thicker. They are fragile so if you want to carry any items with weight, they could easily rip these open. I like the T-top shape for easy carrying and tying into knots when done.
23a30c1d-11cc-40f8-8b4a-d47ce0ae7e25	5	My best friend loved it
ebbb33e4-8c54-4081-ad53-ab2a3fd6ab55	5	I was using a built Neoprene lunch box that needed to be replaced. This one is bigger, the zipper is more rugged i don't feel like it will fall apart and i have noticed that items stay cooler with the same ice pack I was using. Great product for a great price.
2f4659d7-4b98-4cbb-995a-56a6e708a211	5	Awesome!
d7e1e702-6bd4-490a-91ca-521dfb0396b3	5	These are huge ice cubes really nice works well easy to remove cubes fast ship.
53f6695b-061f-4cd9-9f97-8f46ffa2d14f	5	Bought this as a surprise for my daughter.  I introduced her to Dr. Who in the 1980's but she did not become a fan the new BBC America series hit the air.
ff108c8e-4b0c-406c-bc3c-28264913e4bf	1	It broke after a week of wearing it
ad6a5541-71d4-4dc8-81e5-28b4c6d90a60	5	I love these vegetable cutters! They make packing lunch for my kids so much more enjoyable. As an added bonus my kids eat more vegetables because of the fun shapes. I use them to not only, cut the fruit and vegetables but also, for their sandwiches. Lastly, these cutters are great quality, easy to clean and so simple to use!!
2c43e76d-db1c-4056-a311-1f70501dbce3	5	Unlike glass french presses where the coffee or tea gets cold rather quickly, the stainless steel retained all of it's heat for the duration of at least 45 minutes! We're able to really enjoy our coffee without having to reheat it in the microwave by cup #2. Our glass press is tiny so if we wanted more than a cup each or if we had company we had to turn into a coffee making machine- no thanks! This is so much sturdier too, making it perfect for camping- I was always paranoid about breaking the glass press and now we can just throw it in with our supplies and go- somehow wrapping things in bubble wrap to take camping always struck me as kinda silly :-)<br /><br />It's also just plain purdy!<br /><br />I received this at a discount as a blogger, however all opinions expressed are my own.
83b7ba0f-afa5-41a6-9096-357fc1f85821	5	Excellent product
a7fad65e-bd4a-41dc-a726-1f550051b23a	2	Smaller than I expected
34b00498-ff09-4175-a101-95dcd39ad8e7	4	Love this braclet , but clasp needs to be better if it gets bumped it falls off. We have lost one already and i purchased another one and had heavy lobster claw put on. It does run a little small for a big man I purchased a 3rd so we could add links. But that just shows you how much I love this braclet that we would jump through hoops to make it work.
f5dc753f-5ff0-4ea6-8b5d-5a0ff7aea486	5	Prettier in person!
201be5e1-02de-495e-9c63-1af4ded62b08	5	I have had these canisters for almost a year and they are wonderful. They are plastic but are really sturdy and I have had no issues with them! I would definitely recommend.
ee9f9b4b-3a9d-4911-a076-e9a9f56a71c8	5	The kids absolutely love them!!!
12b08cae-da43-4954-84df-9297fb304fdc	5	Very pretty, uniform little Chrysocolla drops. The tiny Lapis beads are great addition.
475ea613-4d38-4597-b6fe-a358c8f12786	5	Perfect
bab3be6e-f3ef-4a7d-846e-a6f59dc0e085	1	Plastic, NOT amber. Refund, please?
371a5173-683e-48a0-b71b-58c7847ea917	2	Leaky dressing container and the salad container leaks, too. I had balsamic everywhere. I'll go back to Mason jars and other containers!
4da8b371-4135-49f2-a0f9-5f91dc900caa	4	I ordered 5 of these, all came on on time as expected. They are very shiny and seem to be good quality. My only complaint is that I thought the pendants and chain were smaller - this is probably my fault for not looking at the specifications. The necklace is pretty - but If you're looking for something a little more understated then this probably won't be the necklace for you. The chain is very thick and the pendant is about the size of a quarter.
9b9213fe-cebe-4eac-a3ac-bd79fcf4bb2e	2	The spout is hard to open up and when I muscle it open fluid just flies everywhere.  See you later BlenderBottle and my $7.
8db565b9-b625-46ca-a04b-fd48f4c1c726	5	Ty is a beautiful ring received it today
f550bb80-a6af-4b36-b2ec-5940bf0055f7	3	they work for what they are but the gems fall out sometime within a day of wearing them. but i lose the gem part all the time when trying to change out them.. they were good for being back ups..
3ab485f1-8c4c-4fe6-9022-50548eddc78e	1	Way too small for the price
d5c17875-a2fe-476a-8b18-b481bb40b569	4	I was skeptical when I ordered, a tungsten ring at this price?  When I got it I was surprised by the quality  and workmanship.  The only reason for 4 stars is completely on me.  The outer edges are a square edged, the inside is a comfort band and I would have liked a bit more of a rounded edge, which may occur over time naturally.
80262769-8bb3-41b5-806c-eda6d5cad6ae	4	I like this salt & pepper grinder. The combination creates less clutter in the kitchen. It's simplistic design goes well with any kitchen design and it's really simple to use. It's wide opening also makes it easy to fill the grinder up. My only concern is that when I first took it out of the box it didn't want to grind at first...? I may have tightened it too much, I'm guessing. Not too sure what happened but it works fine now and it's great! I love having fresh pepper and salt with a simple twist.
4d3dfd9e-1ea7-4136-81c7-0e55f1f6f1fb	4	Wish they had different designs
953dcbaa-2364-44ec-8542-b35d1f49ce4b	5	well made, love the lids.
1de45dc9-2e85-4e7d-aefc-35cbd36c79e3	5	My freezer tends to over freeze alot of dairy products and I always struggle to scoop ice cream, and end up having to be near the hot water tap - placing a spoon back and forth from the ice cream to the hot tap water in order to get a scoop out without breaking my arm lol  The Sumo ice cream scoop allowed me astonishing with ease to scoop out ice cream without any arm breaking strength.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the scoop handle is thick and durable and nothing on this scoop appears to be a cheap quality (its actually a heavy feeling scooper, impressive).  It actually a very impressive scoop that allows you to scoop ice cream without added extra arm strength.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review.
118c00df-8b08-4794-8921-15463f361e91	4	There are different styles for the balls. Also, there is a lot of white, blue, and red. Not enough black. Other then that the quality is great and they were nicely organized by 5 and all the jewelry was there
2d4ea92a-5a30-48ca-9c83-dad54bcca288	5	Lovely earrings.
bb9c7649-379d-4c84-aadc-475a5293cea6	5	My husband and I love this bottle.We use it everyday and makes drinking water soooo much more easier now..!!!! The insert can be removed easily to fill it with fruits of your choice. Easy to clean too. The only thing that I thought would make this a better product is the presence of a handle to hold the bottle. Apart from that, I think this is the best you get out there for the price.
812a49d1-1503-4292-84a7-bce09f387969	5	Holds temperature very well but too skinny a size to be held firmly in a car's cup holder.
56629e68-c383-4991-ab5e-f50a02c54985	5	There are great! So cute! I love them!
737159fe-af6a-4b1e-bd14-7ffc9a23fe2f	5	Great quality! Fits great on a Pandora bracelet!
06defb3f-eaea-43a2-b7c1-73d88497d394	3	Works good, but handles come off easily  and can get lost.
8e9ae965-0378-454f-a80b-94a9c58434aa	1	This peeler was no different from those we already had for our regular kitchen needs. And, it isn't as nice as others we have.
5159ad9c-111d-4244-afe7-34f94235e75c	5	Wonderful addition to any kitchen. Bought a set for me and a set for a gift. The are a nice set and more sturdy then I expected and since they nest they take up very little room. The ability to pour makes for a less messy process while cooking. Love them and will be ordering more since all my friends think they are great. And the price is outstanding.
7dd93199-4b31-4b7c-aea5-4c8cc18b9a9c	5	Very cute
6979a062-06f4-42ec-b2f1-eba7ca41eeb4	2	Very cool but a pain to get all the cubes out
cf9515cc-9c1c-4ac8-93b0-2a250bdd64ce	1	Dreadful Machine. Would not recommend.
0eb7f81f-33fe-4c58-ba02-0641dc8a224e	5	When you just need to keep it macho , tough , simple , rugged . Perfect . Thanks .
e8a71495-e12f-45b9-852f-6e5db9738b16	5	Cute earrings. I had a little trouble putting them in but I think its because I just recently gauged my ears to size 0 and they weren't completely healed when I put these in.
66f5a06c-dda5-48be-a885-1d36f9810a04	5	This product performs as advertised, is easily mounted/unmounted and does a great job sharpening all sorts of blades.
926ead60-c6ba-4a9d-9954-8f907973934c	5	Beautiful chain, love the length about a 20&#34;, stunning styling.
19fcbf03-dd2f-4765-a9ae-69b8d5a26c18	5	Ring is true to size, well made, and chunky for people with big hands.<br /><br />The only negative that I could think of is that they don't offer half sizes.
a36095fa-6c76-4805-9686-87fd24015cf9	5	I wore this ring over the week-end and I had all my friends ( who know I have been married for 31 years) ask me if I got engaged. I love the way it looks on my hand and it isn't heavy on my finger, even as big as it is. It doesn't feel or look like a fake diamond. This feels very natural on my finger. I would buy this for my fiance if I was a guy and was getting engaged and as a woman I would love to get this for an engagement ring. I will recommend this seller to anyone I know that is getting engaged and is on a budget.<br />I received this for a discount for my honest and unbiased review
4ffa4495-4537-4a24-89f5-119e8089e110	1	Cheap
c1e47ebd-68d9-455e-8399-14303ad9baa0	5	Amazing
67b1abe4-94c1-4bd3-a54c-c2daa4fc69b8	5	Exactly what I was looking for. Gorgeous quality, good price. The bar doesn't turn that weird brown color like the stainless steel does. I absolutly love this belly ring.
b78ba370-dbc4-4cf1-bb86-82a0565e890b	4	Just like the silverware, I loved the colors of these. The ONLY con was these specifically were on the smaller side, but it ended up working in my advantage.
710af073-dda5-46d7-af7a-cf989916fb49	4	Nice artwork
463c58fc-70da-469c-85c0-0e3ab7fe5c75	4	Great! Have been using it for a month!
8d180f7a-6afb-4d29-8b30-e0db86fe9abb	5	Perfect size for saving oil for frying. I keep one for savory and another for sweet foods.  Easy to clean between uses, too.
613c00ca-6923-42b8-ad0e-d25d084e749f	5	Love this! It's small, but I don't know why people complain about small beads because it just means more will fit on later...<br />I bought two; one for each side.
cc93aeef-5039-4e2f-ab6f-cbe40b9ee659	5	Great backpack for price. Shopkins are real fun in my house so my daughter loves this.
bfc43db3-53be-42eb-82cd-182f84d41bf5	5	Football touchdown celebration shot glasses do I need to say more
0d27de38-b45d-4348-b996-d0c61ed42381	5	Great looking strong feeling pan.... have not used yet. Heavy duty feel to it. Great value.
ecd51f89-4f99-424f-bebe-bec79ec28c73	5	These earrings from Glimmering are stunning! I was so happy to get two pairs in this set, it comes with a silver pair and a gold pair which is perfect for being able to match them to different clothing. I am usually sensitive to earrings, but these have not caused any issues for me at all. The backs are of great quality and are easy to attach. I was worried that these would feel heavy in my ears due to the size of the stones, but they are so lightweight I forgot I was wearing earrings at all.  Included in this set is a very nice royal blue velvet drawstring pouch that easily fits into a jewelry box.  It also comes with a certificate of authenticity to show that these earrings are made with genuine Swarovski Crystals.  I am incredibly pleased with the quality and beauty of these earrings!  They would make a great gift for any occasion!
cc367014-35f1-4358-becb-e8ca7957cb23	4	slightly smaller than standard size, they wobble around in my muffin pan. Kind of hard to clean and I had to soak them for 3 days to get the grease and meatloaf smell out of them. I will not use them for meatloaf again, but they make a very nice clean muffin.
09b8bcea-6d0c-4709-bc67-8fc78087d646	5	GOOD DEAL
232ac5ca-5b6b-4bb3-b63e-854b9f44e4bd	5	I got this necklace in today and it's beyond beautiful. The rose gold color is so pretty. I also love the pearl  it complements the style of the necklace. The mini crystal design in the middle adds detail to the necklace. I'm happy with this product.
06745f5c-d06f-41e6-bbd9-83caccc3be1a	1	These are HUGE!! The description and photos make them out to look smaller and dainty. But they are not. And I was missing some pieces in my order. Very low quality, I do not recommend.
874f17fa-eca0-4ab8-bbee-a49c70145646	5	These are super! the tension spring or whatever that makes them work is perfect--not too tight, not loose. Their appearance is subtle, just the dark circle but it adds panache! Now if they could put a couple of beads on it (and adjust the tension for the weight) I'd buy more of them. Hey, maybe a lt-wt bead or so could be threaded on? They could be customized then to whatever outfit one is wearing! They feel 'sturdy' enough to take a small additional weight.  Off to the bead shop I go !
adc59d80-303c-46d7-aba6-b104f4a4f934	5	This grinder is sleek and easy to use. It's separate compartments allow for storage, herb grinding and portability. There's a small scraper included to remove loose residue from the screen and clean the device. This grinder is durable, but it's lightweight and not super heavy like a lot of other grinders on the market. It's simple to use and offers options. I received this grinder in return for my unbiased opinion.

f1d03854-3502-4c9f-ba4e-762a61f3b180	1	I am very disappointed in this product the first set I received were scratched and two were cracked. I returned them and received a new set. Now I've had them for a couple of weeks and the first time I hand washed them two of them filled up with water that I couldn't get out of the glass. I threw them away and now one other one fills up with what ever you put in them....so buyer beware.
e36a5f9e-2f9b-4564-9827-b3d9f55453ce	5	Exactly as described - and precisely what I was looking for !  Great everyday necklace, delicate yet I haven't taken it off in days - chain does not snag my hair like most do.  Lightweight yet seems quality - a terrific value !  Prompt delivery.
25b033ca-7f99-406a-9cfe-25746c56fc6f	5	Same quality as the original factory one
bbb39e5f-0f30-42be-b028-9c84733f546e	5	I bought these for my boys. They love them. The are big and sturdy. The only down side is they have to be hand washed because the mask is glitter. But it's not a deal breaker.

a5d20722-a98a-4031-9612-01160649054d	4	I would have gave it 5 stars if it came in a 8 1/4. I bought size 8 and it does fit pretty well. Just a 8 1/4 would have been perfect. Looks really nice and is light weight.

421e76ce-595a-4ba0-9c4d-d2b420fc4486	5	I've started using this for woodcarving and while there have been no major slip-ups, it has protected me well so far from some potential nicks and scratches. Comfortable fit and flexible material

f001fb8c-96a9-49f5-84a0-beb2682a18ba	1	This product is terrible.  I feel like the reviews I read prior to purchase, which were all positive, must be paid endorsements. I don't know how to explain it.  Please avoid this cheaply made can opener.
d4c8cd0a-9fe3-491e-a245-4af8aeeafbc8	5	This nose ring is incredibly comfortable. I wear it for work and no one can even tell its in.
c9456ff9-61f5-4739-9b46-37d8a8ec6f49	2	Got it as a birthday gift. It does make good popcorn, but they are some draw backs.<br /><br />The first time I used it I had to clean up a big mess as the popcorn would bounce out of the bowl and it is too hot to put your hands up to stop the popcorn from bouncing out of the bowl. Finally had to hold a large frying pan over the bowl so that half of the kernals did not end up on the floor.<br /><br />Way too much unpoped kernals (20-30%) end up in the bowl or on the floor.

63511115-001f-44c3-a3ee-1191ce59e20c	5	Bought this for my husband and he loved it. This was the second purchase from this seller. I had bad luck with the first but overall the bracelets do have a nice appearance to them. If they changed the material they used to hold them together it may make the bracelets more sturdy other than that they're nice bracelets.

19f78658-0540-4bab-89f9-a22dcb27c023	5	I needed an inexpensive 5 gallon pot to make demi glace.  The recipe uses 10 pounds beef bones, 10 quarts of water, and 1-2 pounds veggies.  Fit perfectly.
b523452f-5974-44c0-ad1a-a052b011e34d	5	I absolutely love these.  I love princess cut and white gold.  Nice quality.  Perfect size. The Swarovski crystals shine like a real diamond.  My sister actually thought they were real.
a0814b13-654b-4735-805f-0db842c6414b	5	The gemstone is nice and looks elegant. The included chain is of good quality(unlike with some gemstone necklaces where the included neck-chain feels cheap and easily breaks.  It's good that the hook is easy to unhinge. Overall the design goes well with a casual type attire or something a little more upscale(which makes it versatile). And of course this would me a great gift for a loved one.
dbf19161-12fb-4cfd-a3c6-3a999f23485f	5	First off the pictures do this ring no justice whatsoever. This thing is stunning. I've gotten so many compliments on it to. Quality is exceptional. The comfort fit is perfect. The carbon fiber inlay makes it so different and stand out but it's not flashy. It keeps a perfect shine, if you get something on just wipe it off and boom back to looking brand new. King will you knocked  it out of the park for me. If you are even considering this ring and you think it looks good in the pictures do yourself a favor and hold it for yourself and you won't be disappointed.
414af967-9c18-4e1c-a6ca-f6404c6e1e75	5	A GREAT pan for jam...
75dd45f4-cd91-45f2-acf6-1c24764c4e6f	5	I got this for my camper so I could bring easily set the napkins outside when we ate at the picnic table.  Love that the arm holds the napkins down and is attached to the base so it doesn't fall off during transportation.

9026e8df-fc2d-437b-b1b1-225eeeaac5e4	5	Before I even received this product I received an email from Jane Carney, who I'm assuming is the CEO of JNC  products. I was excited to receive the skillet skrunchie, as I'm tried a myriad of different brushes which have all been mediocre and painstaking to utilize on my cast iron.  In my first use of this product I was just shaking my head and laughing at how easy this was to utilize, but JNC products and Jane without a doubt already made me a big fan just from being proactive and reaching out to me.  Terrific product from nice people
7def10ce-101d-4117-bfd2-44aeb80bb73a	5	WORKS GREAT SHIPPED FAST
adcc1f23-9130-4e28-97dd-95c06b03f138	2	Was kinked in box, sharp edges, short, very thin.
42f1a61b-2703-498f-8afc-43aac659554c	2	Super cute but the door broke off the first time I used it,  the screws busted the wood.
7eb48d51-e780-4f7e-a429-ceb397672262	5	So far so good.  I have had this for a month and works fine.  It is a little bit big and bulky, but looks nice and is efficient.
73399229-02b3-4017-a0bd-43577188acb0	5	This is outstanding and am judging all others by it.  Man made or not it looks like a real opal, lots of fire, great size, arrived very fast, looks super on the bracelet.  Am very pleased, would order again from them for sure.  Appreciate their honesty.
13998d8e-7f81-4faa-b722-5f2560275d84	4	Nice, but rather small.

Beautiful colors bold and vibrant. Ring doesnt look cheap or fake. Has a masculine look and feel. That's what we wanted.
7997635d-7c2d-47f6-a8e1-477deaf34deb	5	Awesome! Came real quick! I also got a mityvac MV8000 brake bleeder kit to use this seal manually and it works great!
26dd3f25-668d-4ccc-b2ad-2b63e8d4a902	5	Lovely.  The colors are vivid and gorgeous.  Very nice setting.
0a3b69ba-0041-4467-8eb7-4603e4e41c4c	1	I sent this ring back because it looked incredibly fake, and nothing like the picture.

f0204266-2b55-428b-80ca-2d01d6ad7f82	4	This is a nice set I sent it back because it was broken
f39c382f-e9c3-4ed1-822a-1c3b41d9a1c1	4	Excellent product, might need super glue, only one of the earrings had a bad glued magnet, other than that, they're wearable.. Might start hurting ears after a few hours but other than that, it's a good product, shiny too.
fb716b0a-344b-48f5-90f4-92db51c00dde	5	Very pretty and sparkly! Lightweight. Would recommend to others!!
21f8760b-a8dc-42c2-af8e-df110e0b53b4	5	Works as advertised. Not as noisy as others have rated
db849e5b-7d47-4e1d-999d-2b39a6c0a79e	5	So far it's gorgeous. I've only had it a few days and I pray it doesn't fall apart or rust or wear real bad. If so I'll definitely update but for now it's everything I wanted plus more
7f1205bf-33a5-4f7d-b030-32c6b9333c20	5	I appreciated the beauty of this product and the magnetized closure.
02b2181a-5c46-4769-bb18-0062d25c1da3	5	I am an avid reviewer and tell the honest truth. I got this bracelet because of the tree of life charm. Plus the leather is light weight and I don't like wearing heavy bracelets. This has not come off my wrist since I got it over a month ago! It does not have clasps, it ties so that you can adjust the wrist size. The only clasp is to the hanging charm. I must admit confusion of how so many people said theirs broke the first day etc. I went on vacation with it, have 3 kids and one on the way,  get showers in it, soak in the bath, wash dishes, sleep in it....like I said I have not taken it off once. Because of its durability I am back to buy more from the seller. I love it and recommend it highly!
300d14db-dbc1-42c5-83c8-26799e9ee9ca	3	Awkward to put together, hopefully it'll stand up to the test of time!
41f50d5b-42b1-4985-927d-268ae7b63668	5	I love it despite its micro size.
639cedc1-b14f-49e1-a39c-226cd7f1d394	4	Came on time. Were tangled. I had to do some repair. Nothing to serious. I like the color a lot. A little small for me. The price was worth it.

5e80cc7b-7875-4596-9b12-6055203b9a10	3	I was expecting a bigger beads. This is really small and looks very plimpsy
3fcfc5d0-8c10-43ae-9ef5-50427556c6ed	5	Just given the heads up from the company, that I left my review in the wrong spot, since im not used to writing reviews, and I'm glad to rewrite it here. I received the knife with a small chip in it, immediately talked with customer service, and had a new one delivered a couple days later, just as promised. It was without a doubt, the best experience I've had with a company's customer service department.<br />  Not forgetting to mention...the knife is awesome, beautiful and cuts like a razor. I'm going to need an entire knife block full of them
d96a0442-a1a6-4ea8-974f-4b11e3a674b8	3	It's a decent peeler that is easy to clean. The corer at the top of it is not super sharp or pointy, which makes it a little difficult to dig out the holes in potatoes. VERY easy to grip.
a4542301-9253-4089-857f-8542dba492f1	5	High quality mug. Very nice hammering details. Good and sturdy! A little discoloration around the top, but copper is known to do that, and it is nothing major. I got this mainly for decorative purposes to go with my other mule mugs from distilleries, so I can't honestly say how well it works for drinks, but from the looks of it, it would work just fine.

295fe272-0b87-43db-8f6f-c39db455185b	5	This is now my favorite nipple ring. It's comfortable and I can't even feel it. The color is awesome as well. It's a bit more dull than grey, but it goes so well with my skin complexion. No irritation or discomfort.

4944ccb5-d0cc-4a97-a2aa-092019e9d571	5	Ordered on Wednesday, arrived on following Monday, 23 Days early.  Star was upright, (point towards the chain bale) not inverted and is very impressive.  Very Pleased!

58c13fe9-147b-4542-8678-3c295e5b3a22	4	This is a fun casual piece for the price. It has a lobster claw hook that is very sturdy.  I didn't give five stars because, I think, it looks like the price I paid and not anymore.
af824988-667c-4208-9810-407bbde6ad02	5	Great uses for this piece.
5b272de5-2034-4cd3-bef3-72a2f77d4495	5	Work just as well as advertised. Very glad I purchased.

8c866c49-eb7e-419e-89b9-7fa922f18f27	4	I would have given 5 stars if it cleaned itself.  Great Juicer, probably the best on the market.. only drawbacks are the size and weight of the juicer.  This is not a machine you are keeping in a cabinet and taking it out once or twice a day, this is a counter fixture ( why I bought this sharp looking model),  It makes great juice.  It is not too hard to clean if you clean it immediately. You have 6 parts to clean, only one takes a little elbow grease that is the mesh basket/blade which needs to be cleaned well with the provided brush, every thing else is a quick sponging rinse.  Highly Reccomended !
cd78c10e-7d26-478a-ae0b-bd999ccfcdde	5	works good does what it should
797be056-fd8b-4979-8a5a-6a78eb486f40	3	It's very small, but ok for the price paid I think.

2741c230-14b8-49ce-8dd5-cde428a9fa10	5	So far so good! Great quality. The juice bottle that's included leaks a bit and its extremely hard for my preschooler to open but what do you expect? I didn't by this for the juice bottle anyway, that was just an added bonus.

7a6faaee-a05d-4671-a773-9c2cac07aafd	5	I love these, you can fall asleep in them, they are so comfortable. They are a bright silver with brilliant cuts on the thicker end to catch the light. They are also mirror opposites so they frame your face nicely.

f83d88d0-3e97-417b-9b74-55d6262e58b2	5	I have been using this for almost a year. The quality is excellent, It has not scratched at all, even with occasional use of metal spoons.<br /><br />I use this mostly as a wok and for making one pot meals. It retains heat well, and is a breeze to clean up after use.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this product again, or other products by this manufacturer without hesitation.

I really needed this steamer as I start my weightloss journey. Steaming food is healthy. Plus using a steamer is simple. It has 3 little legs on the bottom that allow you to set the steamer in a pan. It has small holes so your food doesn't fall out of the pan while steaming.  A great way to prepare a variety of healthy vegetables. The steamer is stainless steel and very easy to clean. It comes with a bonus julienne peeler/slicer. Highly recommended

When my daughter had a cup of coffee at my house recently she said, &#34;Wow, all you taste is coffee&#34;.  That's right, no aluminium or plastic flavors tainting our wonderful organic coffee.  Flavored with Stevia and organic coconut milk powder, it's all good. And I must add it has a 5 year warranty. Love this coffee maker.

b6a65567-3b5d-4042-a059-a807461fdcfb	5	The dumbest thing is for those dopes who reviewed this product without even buying and then give it one star. I personally read many reviews on this product and other of various sizes. All silliness aside, I purchased the one that makes 4 small balls at once and have yet to make them well. I also purchased this jumbo sized set and have had great luck. I wish they had something to grab onto as they are a little difficult to pry apart. BUT, the most important thing is they produce nice clean, round ice balls for my beverages.<br />ALSO, these jumbo balls fit my scotch glasses perfectly.

They are always so beautiful.<br />This Swarovski Elements Crystal Heart Shaped Bracelet is gorgeous!<br />It is made of White Gold Plated Alloy which should hold up really well without rusting like regular plated jewelry. And Alloy is so much easier to keep clean and shiny.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars only because It is a little on the small side, luckily I have smaller wrists so it fits but is still a little snug. If you have bigger wrists then it might not fit you. And it is very hard to put it on yourself.<br /><br />I really love how the crystals sparkle when the sun hits them. It looks so beautiful and stunning. The hearts are different sizes. The middle one is bigger then it goes smaller and smaller which makes it a really beautiful design.<br /><br />It came in a beautiful gift box with a cleaning cloth to keep your bracelet shiny.<br />This bracelet looks gorgeous no matter what I wear it with so it's very versatile.<br />This would make a great present for any woman in your life. And it would also make the best Bridesmaid gift.<br /><br />** This product was received at no cost for review and inspection purposes, No compensation for a positive review was provided.

eef18854-1a1d-48e8-8780-76ebb1c268a5	5	I love this piece ~ it is beautifully made and very elegant.  Just enough shimmer to catch the eye, but not gaudy.  Devon Leigh makes gorgeous and high quality jewelry.  Very happy with my bracelet.
