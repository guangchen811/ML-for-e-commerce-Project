e61dca8b-3577-4c88-a9de-47db3bc3cc99	4	I have been using this for the last few weeks and I love it!

a6260267-9a39-454f-80fa-5232909049e0	5	It is easy to use the single serve coffee brewer and we are enjoying coffee being made quickly. The brewer met our expectation's.

34fe8d10-3554-4b0c-99a6-a000bdc47b9b	5	I have several Cross pens and they are a smooth writing, long lasting instrument. This particular pen is a gift.
f768c63e-616c-4578-9b60-d2c66972992c	5	Love this coffee maker. I have had one of the original models for years and decided to upgrade and donated my old one to work.  The added features on the 400 series like the strong option and carafe are awesome.  The light in the reservoir is a cool bonus, works great as a night light.  Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review.
5e60bd1b-28ca-4119-bc43-c4201cef0247	5	I ordered 3 pieces of jewelry from here and they all are great pieces. Only thing about this particular piece is that its just a tad bit too big but not big enough to slide off my wrist at any time.. so still a great piece!!
acc327b7-d749-4900-86d2-5dea1ebb4193	5	Exactly what I was looking for!  First time, left a little too much room for the ice expansion, but after that - perfect ice balls every time!
ef3ac854-c6a0-4dd4-8342-4c20d15edac7	4	Works as expected.

We had a manual one as a backup, but we both had so much trouble trying to get it to work, that we tried another one.  My fiance can get the newer manual one to work but I can't, I have to squeeze so hard that it hurts my wrist.  When I saw that Bartelli was looking for reviewers of their Soft Edge Automatic Can Opener, I applied right away.<br /><br />Thankfully they selected me and provided me with an Amazon code to order the blue version for free.  When it arrived I quickly ran to the store to get some AAA batteries which are not included so I could test it out.<br /><br />At first I was making it out to be harder than it really was.  You simply mount the can opener on the can, press the button to turn on, let can opener swivel around the can, press the button again to turn off the can opener when it has made a complete circle.  Because the can stays flat on the counter, I don't have to worry about any contents spilling out, especially on larger cans like when I used a stand up electric can opener.<br /><br />I love that this design doesn't take up much space, and can be stored in a drawer.  Our counter  space is very limited so not having to plug this can opener in makes prepping meals at the kitchen table a  breeze.<br /><br />This product cuts around the side of the can to eliminate sharp and dangerous edges, creating an easily re-sealable lid with a smooth edge. That makes it easy to keep food covered while preparing a meal.<br /><br />This is perfect for those with carpal tunnel issues, arthritis or any other hand pain, as it requires no manual labor.
2eb0961b-9bb1-4c1d-8b71-4180e706534f	5	On point
afd402e6-1bba-43d4-9ef7-b3706409e38c	4	I like the fit and the colors. They are not faded. Its well made and I think its pretty durable. The only hing i dislike is the left over string where they finished tying it. It sticks out and the string is coming undone. It doesnt affect the bracelet though because it cant undo itself more than where they tied it.
34ac55e7-6e90-45b5-a586-e3e8cde05e34	5	This is the best vegetable peeler I have used so far. I like its handle...great design! I got the red one. It stands out among the black and stainless kitchen product I have. Above all, the blade is sharp and it peels really thin. Very happy with this product.
1cf19399-953a-4444-baa1-c99285443d32	5	my second pan like this.  It has a lid that goes with it.
66491d95-37ce-4f40-9058-d4cb725f2afc	3	Everything was very well packages, and clean. However I got the wrong size needles! I got 16G needles with 14G rings. I could not do the piercing, I tried and it caused lists of pain from the different sizes.
6621caa1-2a47-4c18-8dd2-d15c4e4312b4	1	So cheaply made that the stones fell out before they even got to my house.
f9c56e5a-2663-4777-8076-76ee5e6309f7	5	Loved my little Crockpot for work. Used it only a few times, but my food comes out great with all its juices.
ab09b9c4-bcd2-44ed-9873-79fb0ecd67ac	1	Did not. Order
1d0f80ab-0fa6-42ec-907e-95e271358b9b	5	Very pretty! Love this stone!

a76c0826-b5c9-4c83-b678-74dcdf92d8b5	4	thought is was bigger
e9e4fddb-f5d7-4fad-a2ca-84c659a2fec1	4	It's a bit flimsy when you turn it out to be a traditional style wisk , but I love it as a flat wisk!
cc9d4991-a063-4a56-882e-2bdf2fe24be4	5	These are fabulous,  I absolutely love them.  They much better and easy to assemble then the stupid cardboard things that Wilton company sells.
dbd8ada8-2755-4867-8dc2-8046a235c46a	5	I just received this today and I did use it on one of my Lodge pans that was clean but had a few carbon pieces that had become part of the pan over the years. It very easily knocked those pieces off. I've been wanting some of this (or one of these) for a while but I find it easy enough to take care of cast iron without anything special. Depending on what you do with your pans though, sometimes nothing works as well as a specialized piece designed for that very purpose. Let me say though, I have never used one of these before nor have I ever seen or handled them anywhere else so I cannot say how this compares to the other pieces of chainmail on the market. So that being said, this is heavy duty, well put together and a good grade of stainless and as I said, it works... And it did something that I was going to have to use something like a chisel or perhaps a strong flat head screwdriver for (although I didn't want to take the chance of gouging the pan surface). There is merit to &#34;the right tool for the right job&#34;. I got this at a promotional price in exchange for an honest review (to be fair, they never said they expected a review of any kind so maybe &#34;in exchange&#34; is the wrong term but that's implied). Honestly, I do not think I would have purchased this otherwise even though I said I have wanted one, for a few reasons, one is my cast iron has been meticulously cared for and has a great no stick surface so clean up is a snap, and another is I don't really use the pans for let's say a scrambled egg and cheese casserole or something that has the potential to be that messy... That is where I could see something like this coming into its own and were that the case, I would be all over something such as this. And that's why the 4 stars rather than 5. For me, this is a very specialized utensil, and as of yet I don't really see any other use for it. If this hits the mark for you, then yes, 5 stars for the build and materials and the company. If I figure outanother use for this, I'll let you know. ***************** I just changed this from 4 to 5 stars, this thing is great for cleaning grill grates and also the grill ridges in a stove top griddle, as long as it's not coated with something like Teflon. Now this has multiple uses for me and that's the fifth star!
ef884d81-0309-491e-bb76-fbf13173fdfd	5	balloons. they blow up. they dont defalte for a whil.e
bd8f77d8-af0d-4928-9f91-c155044a48cc	5	This is a great tool for fun veggies! I just received mine today, and already convinced my &#34;ewww...vegetables!&#34; kid to join me in zucchini and eggs for breakfast...and she LOVED them. Can't wait to try out other veggies. VERY easy clean-up, and small enough to drop in a drawer. I can foresee a very busy future for my Zoodle!
4d736ae6-5950-4241-9d70-d7acd2d0bd09	5	Easy to use & it stores nicely!
baa90425-1179-4c11-aad7-bbe646fa2556	1	Arrived broken!
0d3d2799-aaf1-4c31-9533-ee16ec4c3fb3	5	My 5 year old granddaughter liked these sparkly earrings and was impressed with the pretty silver box they came in.
714b4282-7773-416f-9031-50784580dc45	5	I use these to make scented wax melts, they work like a charm.  Received sooner than expected too!!
dcaab57e-2ae1-4662-96f3-40629b0ec8e5	5	Love my charms
77398786-8b44-4f8e-a35e-b87071fe6e3c	5	Can't wait to wear these on the first day of school. The kiddos always get a kick out of my pencil earrings, im sure they'll love these too. Perfect size- they look just like the picture.
cd3b254e-1398-4001-9642-eba75d67dfad	5	It's a pitcher - it's solid and doesn't leak - no complaints!
7026f0cc-8370-4abf-a2d8-1f59244f0700	5	Simply stunning! Being from South Louisiana, we attend a lot of formal Mardi Gras balls, Twelfth Night parties, Festival balls, etc.  This is the perfect piece of jewelry to dress up a simple formal or semi-formal gown. The necklace incorporates lots of colors and could really be paired with a multitude of things. I like big, chunky, glamorous jewelry, and this is definitely a stunner! I have a lot of my great grandmother's antique jewelry and this reminds me of something from the 1940's. The colors of the necklace remind me of the beaches of Cancun and the beautiful shades of blue waters and the yellow sunshine. It comes packaged in a red velvet drawstring bag. Mine came in with a stone missing, I assume from shipping, but I am working on getting it exchanged as I type. This is definitely not a cheap, lightweight piece! It is so much more than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised! I do not think you will be disappointed at all with this piece, especially for the price! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
e8f86669-aa81-4ecc-9711-6f1d7eb6c07f	4	My husband is a bartender and does private events in addition to his job at the bar. I think of the &#34;small things&#34;...like keeping the dust out of the bottles with the pourers. He got the tyre of pourer spouts with the flaps for his bar, but the plastic black ones (w/o flaps) for home. These fit perfectly. Great price, serve their purpose well.
36bb9b53-cc30-44d4-8408-23c19b9d6564	5	Bought this for a friend who didn't know how to eat with chopsticks. And she loves it! Great for training!

19d3c205-8dfb-473d-ad21-30514e05e2f5	4	It was as described. Pretty stones. I did not like how it poked me but overall it was as described.
bf4f3700-b6e3-4000-a88d-acf081884641	5	Was exactly as pictured and I recieved it early.
1c6417db-3cda-4a02-bb43-71104c2f5f7a	5	Very pretty.  Like wearing hoops.
b0e6bb50-a31e-44e5-a68d-caaeec6470ad	5	This is a great product. Very happy I bought it. I use it for making lemon zest all the time.
87be9f94-ac75-41d3-bfd1-9c95a2bd65f5	5	Beautiful rings!  They fit and wear comfortably and engraving is clear.  Seller is great too, very communicative and helpful!  The only suggestion I have would be to try to center the engraving more in the middle of the band widths and a bit further away from the tungsten labeling on the inside of the rings.  For the price of the rings and engraving for both this is a great deal!
280256b4-49cd-4f87-a3ca-aa6eea48376e	5	Very pretty and elegant! The crystals are darker than they appear in the photo, and actually look nicer than I expected. I have worn this necklace to work and received several compliments... it looks like you spent more $ than you did :)
2d653c2a-7b5c-4789-82ac-df4e0951131f	1	Were worn less than a week when stone and setting broke off and were lost.
01a0027e-f261-4402-8802-c69ec62eae4c	5	Received on time and as described. Will use again.
a71591fc-91c4-47c0-ad0a-dd33c244738e	4	Very good
033c543c-da1e-4b3c-a11b-261aef50d201	5	it works great, it holds a pint of cream and stays fresh for a while in the fridge if you don't use it all at once.
17b8efe6-e0b2-4e49-a5fe-24bc8568d742	5	Love it got one in silver for the summer and one in gold for the winter I'm thinking about getting one for my daughter and granddaughter..update it has been 6 months now color has changed
edea43cb-e1b7-453b-9e9b-e0efd1592231	3	made flimsy. my hand one with the ring came broken
64a5234d-f9ac-4baa-85d4-22680004effd	3	Thermomenter is great to check my wine fridge, but it can't hang on the wooden racks, so I just stand it up.
6f406526-b139-426e-bd70-be38de9736f9	5	The best lemon squeezer I've ever used! Large enough to fit those monster-sized lemons, strong steel to give them a good squeeze, and small enough holes to not let those darn seeds through. I like the comfort of the handles too. Excellent product.
064d6b5e-68da-4a34-9ba8-f521d61ac27f	5	I bought this because the ring I ordered for my wedding was not going to be delivered in time for my wedding.  I considered cancelling my original one, which cost over $300 and keeping this $20 ring.  I was amazed by the weight, quality and comfort fit of this ring.  This is a solid piece of jewelry and manly looking.  I work a lot with my hands and although I only wore this ring for a few weeks, it was still in perfect condition when the other one arrived.  Very quick shipping also.  Couldn't have been more satisfied.  I told my wife I would wear this ring every year on my anniversary since this is the ring I wore on our wedding day.
45e740ca-473d-47ae-84e1-badd8b3f74b3	5	Perfection. The casting & finish quality are absolutely top notch, handle very comfortable and the bottom edge curvature makes cleaning easier.
d97b6acb-c430-46ca-9751-4a1752af34a7	1	We couldn't even use these, I threw them away. The ice would break into tiny shards rather than pop out like it's supposed to.
3585c0df-540f-4d8c-bb5a-59ee19480cda	5	Matches Bling's Lapis ring nicely. Love the color of the stone, it's a nice deep blue and the silver is nice quality. The earrings aren't too heavy, and I like that the scroll work covers it partially. Seems like a nice secure earring. I'm wearing them now and they are very comfortable.
b8599cbe-1ec2-4884-8584-7418e848c255	5	Fits my cutting boards behind my kitchen sink.  My sink is on a corner, so it fills the space well.  Good use of storage for a small space there.
dd623e94-9422-460f-8c20-190d0d5432f4	5	Ii love this set...I heat milk for my coffee in the microwave and just pour it into the metal carafe.  The other sizes are just as useful.  I will surely give it as presents to lucky folks.
5197ffce-4b62-43a6-907c-3d7e3515b1d6	5	Some real thought went into these holders.  The overall length is 3 1/8 inches and the central spike is 1 1/4 inches.  The central spike extends beyond the screw.  Inserting them is simplicity itself.  Press the central spike into the cob, and then screw it in.  Holds the corn firmly until you're finished eating.  Then simply unscrew and remove.  Note that these are designed to work with corn that has been cut on both ends.  Longevitity is the only question, but these holders look and feel plenty sturdy.  Highly recommended.<br />(10/31/2017)  Here I am again. After two years of chomping these holders are still going strong with no issues whatsoever. I only use four as I gave the other four to a friend shortly after purchase.  As I said before, “Best I've Ever Used !!”
ac66c1cf-e87f-47ab-a391-26acb7797d58	5	My son was so excited when I gave this to him.  He takes it to every band practice.
e0e0053b-f9f3-4f7d-9513-d3e1625ceaf0	5	Perfect for a silver charm
b007e2a8-cd1f-4ed2-b912-1bd1153d4dd1	5	it is one of the few that don't run up to my elbow or falls off I have very small wrist.
9a5c6344-e6a6-486a-ae0d-134ed7de3e1d	5	The patterns are really nice. Works really well. Would but again.
3df801cb-2325-4e31-bc41-ee71ae851664	5	Perfect knives & great storage block.
8d9d81bf-1be2-4226-a5bc-0af09506df22	4	Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. He likes  them. So that's why 4 stars. would be 5 but the jewel seems a little loose, it hasn't fallen out YET, but we expect it because it seems cheaply made
2cd0cb45-48b7-4742-aeea-df2f991cac53	4	I love it! The fries made with it are really good but not greasy. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it is a little bit noisy.
d9c1203c-f961-438f-9e59-ac61df27e038	5	Perfect replacement for an old cutting board.
43bf23a7-6a98-4a05-b49e-b25e84c46935	3	The prompts set in between stones are huge take away the stones a bit.  I will keep it but will not be my favorite.
8adce774-d906-4774-a207-82fa7258e6e7	5	They are very nice.
df28a8ea-508b-4a22-aad0-51c6b986b703	3	Look nice , a little to small  but cute.
0f7a8aca-c7d5-4139-8ecd-5d8501d61088	5	love it and my superman fans gonna love it, good business arrived early .
c9dc0726-b779-44d0-a4f4-7e83baa3cca4	2	I really like it but because im sensitive to certain metals i got an allergic reaction to it.
f72a5f00-b9fd-4f8d-9092-2dfdc6d4485f	5	I am very impressed with how well this bracelet is made and I love how it looks around my wrist. It was made to perfectly compliment a man or women combining brown leather with silver gold and brown beads. It is adjustable with a knot that can be tightened or loosened and will fit wrist 7 to 9 inches. It arrived in a really nice black box that would make it a great gift idea. I received this product discounted in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.
df7e80d4-0708-4d7c-a09d-684b46478dcc	3	The shaker works fine.  I would like it much better if it had a cap/lid for storing without the fear of ants or moisture penetration.  The stencils are nice and work as advertised.  You can also purchase various other latte art stencils to round out your collection.
bc9ecd60-708d-4452-8198-1214edf344c4	4	Works great and does 10 eggs! Only downfall is some of the eggs ooze while cooking so cleanup is a bit more than I'd like.
d9f56461-5547-4ba8-8ba4-a4fdf81de20b	5	This wasn't the most expensive of necklaces, but one of the reviews that had a video sold me.  I'm glad that I bought it.  It's really adorable and doesn't look cheap or tacky.
71d871c8-2a59-42de-96f5-3423ee5d4784	4	you have to play with the clasp a bit but once its on its pretty good
78a62ae0-7c26-4284-81fb-30a716dd2411	4	I honestly wasn't expecting it to be so nice!!! I love it. It was nicely presented and packed. Love love love it
f638499c-6670-496e-a0f6-3e8ad1944343	5	Love, Love, Love this ring.  It's beautiful!
00552178-6074-4f0d-8351-6cb508a9c208	1	I used it once and then it was full of fog, which I can't get rid of.
233528b9-514c-4ff9-91f0-3f2517ffac67	5	Love this ring! It's so pretty! Wish they had 1/2 sizes tho!
3dfab41d-99be-4109-8721-5a3343cd930d	1	This is b less than one star..has no taste I could have got the same taste from a toothpick. .don't buy wasted my money
d8d4ae14-d838-4395-a039-fd2a3b1b5e28	4	This brewer provides many choices as far as cup sizes are concerned. That's a real plus for the selecting the tiny to the large. It also has the carafe that comes in handy when several people are drinking the same flavor. One drawback is that choices of flavors are restricted to cups with the Kuerig  logo. But we have found satisfactory flavored creamers that satisfy different preferences.<br />The reminder to change the filter is a good idea since maintenance is hard for me to keep track of.<br />The choice to brew tea and hot chocolate will probably be used as the weather turns cold and hot beverages are a real necessity.<br />The bottom line is that I really like this model much better than the older one that was used for several years.
0e75b933-ded8-4164-865a-4983b7ba0cc4	4	Absolutely love this product! It slice/cuts very easily. clean up is simple and easy to wash and store.
81ea7456-0733-4f91-b401-2e9e46c19a3d	5	Love these earrings. They beautiful!
c59903d2-a6a1-4b07-ad6b-ba3af90b9f4f	2	color on beads washed off after 3 weeks
02845cd0-2518-4b78-820b-106add23787d	1	I'd give it a negitive if I could.  It buzzes when its plugged in and it only has one setting even though it show's varitable settings.  Its Extreamly hot.... and thats it.  Not worth buying.
00645388-2228-452f-9b5c-7d1a0df1e9d1	5	Remember the 1980’s?  Remember the black plastic lace looking like chokers?  I sure do and I loved them then, I’m glad to see them back now.<br /><br />These come in a set of two, black, which goes with everything and fits right over your head onto your neck.<br /><br />I don’t remember these being punk, I do remember as I said earlier than I loved them back then and do now, and it’s an easy addition to any outfit.<br /><br />I received this item at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion
47e073a8-8bcd-4b50-9d9f-dc3ddd150568	2	It shouldn't be considered jewelry as it has no way of adding it to jewelry. Luckily my boyfriend is a welder and was able to attach it to metal piece so I could add it like a charm
947989d2-3588-4e7c-bb8c-b163cc8d5386	5	It's a very nice bracelet. I've received many compliments when I have wore the bracelet.
ffa40a7d-e690-4369-a98a-f996a465d134	3	I bought these quite a while ago and it took about 3 weeks I understand they came from China but also when I got them the cufflinks were oblong shaped and the bat logo was distorted as you can see from the pic
5371f5cb-856d-4a33-a361-cf542fdf8890	3	it has a strudy blade. would rather have a full handle as fingers thru opening, get pintched as you ad pressure. like cutting  thru ribs rolling forward not the bone.
ebf5111b-fb31-4d62-b42c-b2eaa15a86b1	5	I've had the Spiralizer about a month and have used it many times with different vegetables.  Excellent zucchini or yellow squash pasta, but I think my favorite is what I call onion &#34;nests&#34;.  So much easier and healthier than regular onion rings.  Same with potato nests, or a mixture of potato and onion.  Yum!  Cleanup is also very easy.  So much better than a hand-held model.
40902631-7afd-4a9d-aea0-db4f3f1cbb9c	2	They are a little cheap looking.  Not too bad.
8f4b3c22-5bc8-475b-a428-b167f7995800	3	irritated my skin really bad, I had to take them out :(
1a291ad0-c8e2-4a87-b6ad-88e49e500685	5	exactly as advertized makes delicous zucchini noodles when you don't want all the carbs of pasta.  The little cleaner brush that accompanies it is a life saver.  Very easy to use to clean the small crevices where the blades might collect zucchini pieces
d64d7daf-a942-482c-80b1-9d97e0665d8e	5	Bought this for our &#34;Pirate Room&#34;.  Very pleased with the quality and design.
c2f59659-9fd3-43b4-95ed-c09d19b788dc	5	Nice! I didn't even know stuff like this exist until I got this slicer as a gift. It works great.
e9791924-15c3-4197-8c38-6281c4a864ec	5	Very well crafted
7d6206f8-742d-4c01-9c70-2192d3453089	5	Quality for much less than i paid other places for sterling silver. I'm a happy customer!
b3f807c6-0116-4361-850d-f02b6b840274	5	My husband and I use these corn holders all the time, especially for summer cookouts. They have a nice grip and work very well. I would recommend them.
881b11fc-641b-42f0-9973-68438b222fe4	5	I just received my bento box & I am very happy! ^_^ The design is as pictured & it is a lot bigger than I thought it would be! It also has a really great seal so top & bottom fit perfectly. I only wish they made a matching bag to carry it with. :P
a73f6147-5013-4fb8-ab0b-caefa2ce5284	3	Very colorful! Went well w/ the rest of the Decor for My son's Surfer/beach themed High school grad party. However they were a bit &#34;flimsy&#34; I thgt it would have been a more firm cardboar.  When I tried to hang them(little hole punch on each end) it sagged in the middle. So instead I doublesided tape them to the walls etc for deco. But other than that looked great!
d4dab584-bc5d-4f21-8fc7-1249388c31c1	5	This is a great value. Bonus: made in the USA so no worries that there might be lead or heavy metals hiding in the manufacture of this product.
3254142e-9931-488e-95a4-27e4f784bbbf	3	This is a beautiful ring. I wear it everyday! Love the rose gold! I've washed my hands a few times with it on and the color hasn't faded (as of yet) and it doesn't make my had green. However, the prongs aren't really evenly spaced out, which bothers me a little. It's not really noticeable unless you really look at it.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been a couple weeks now and I've noticed that some of the color has worn off. At least around the band, it's turned like regular gold instead of rose gold. The setting, where the diamond sits is still rose gold so the ring looks two-toned now...
1d92debc-ce16-46dd-9c1b-e8dbb354ecc2	1	This product is a waste of money.  The stopper pops off when it has liquid in it.  And sincs its not attached, it got lost after it popped out .  Horrible!  Save your money.
fd296019-e728-458e-bdf2-c8b3eabf7c93	5	Good quality plastic. And come on. It's a dinosaur pasta spoon.
712529d5-fca5-49a4-b1fa-824f6c2ff099	5	I like this butter dish. It is a little narrow, but works fine.
7941512a-79e7-4a39-a360-0c24d0cadab1	5	Sparkly and shiny.  I like the size and they feel strong-good posts.
4527a9ef-3b6c-45dc-956f-10dad7c952b2	5	fairly good
5f74113f-aaa3-43ab-97b6-d34e56bc14f2	5	If you're wondering from the slightly ambiguous wording in the item description (you know how some sellers would consider the tunnel one piece and the o-ring as another = 2 pcs) -- you DO get two tunnels and two rings of each gauge.<br /><br />The 14 gauges aren't &#34;tunnels&#34; in that they're so small there is no &#34;tube&#34; through them- they are solid, but they do match the style of the rest of the tunnels with the flared fronts and ridged back for holding your o-ring..  getting that TINY o-ring on is tough because it's so small so you might need help (I did).  Also, the 14gs were slightly larger than a standard 14g ring or taper.. not enough that I felt the need to grab my 12g taper, but enough that I did notice there was a difference and it needed a little extra push to get them through.  However, I will say- sleeping with tunnels in your double helixes?  WAY more comfortable than sleeping with rings in them.<br /><br />To be noted- the O-Rings have to be tight- otherwise, they slip off easily and if the o-ring doesn't stay on, your tunnel will fall out in your sleep, and all that stretching progress can be lost- especially if you're working with cartilage, so tight o-rings are a GOOD thing.<br /><br />I have piercings of a variety of sizes in my ears, and have been wanting to gauge my lobes from their 6g & 4gs to 00gs for ever, and just never got around to it..  This kit is perfect for me because I like to stairstep my stretching with a variety of sizes all at once- so I've always got at least one side of my head that I can sleep on.<br /><br />This kit is lovely.  I would never believe that it was a $3 set (when I bought it).  The metal is smooth and polished.  The tunnels are sturdy.  The rings fit tightly.  They're all labeled in individual resealable packages..  Aside from the 14 gauges being slightly large, I can't find any flaws with any of them.<br />This set is definitely worth the gamble.<br /><br />Came back to edit a week later--<br />I justwanted to add- a week in- and no problems, no skin reactions, no signs of rust (some cheap sets do that), the rings have stayed tight, and I still love them on all counts.<br /><br />Came back a MONTH later--<br />Once again, I came in to add- it's been a month with them in- and NO problems, no signs of rust, no deterioration of the o-rings- and I still love them.<br /><br />Came back TWO YEARS later--<br />I am still using these.  I have the two 10g in my helixes- they have been in there from day one- taken out only for cleaning, they have gone through showers/baths and hair products being sprayed around them every day for that entire time.  No sign of rust, no irritations, no issues whatsoever.  Not a single tunnel in the set has given me any trouble.  As time went by a few of the smallest o-rings got a little hard- but that did not lessen their ability to do their jobs- and I'm still using the original o-rings on them.<br /><br />If I could give them a higher rating I would.  I just can't tell you enough- even at the new price- THIS SET IS WORTH THE MONEY.<br />Awesome set for an even awesome-r price.

1b171dfe-b13e-4c71-8337-12e102268f99	5	I now can cook a lot of dishes that require slow and long cooking time without burning them up because of this little helper here. It diffuses the heat evenly and prevent the pot or pan from burning or having food stick to the bottom for longer cooking time dishes.
4e1faad1-d049-4fef-9385-ecf1b0e54d48	4	Bamboo cutting board  Have only had it a few months.  Used regularly but seems to be holding up ok.  I did use some mineral oil to protect it as it doesn't have any kind of oiled finish on it.
de02cfdb-b10a-484f-957d-b0cf11cbdac5	5	Good price, perfect size, easy to clean.
c5564131-2e9f-4dcb-86af-b9e96f9bf647	5	Best serving tool. No scratches and very solid. Bought for myself and for a friend. We both love it.
c8d1378e-ca50-4ad8-99d3-3ebe5283933d	5	They are beautiful.  Thank you for sending them promptly. They were for my granddaughters to keep their mom close. They each love there pendant.
b0170384-c254-4720-a79a-63edbd9b8ed8	5	great
00965ac4-99f8-4feb-93db-1ff71ce1e134	5	Exactly as advertised.  These tongs have a good weight to them and I love the silicone lining to prevent burns.  Highly recommended.
45d3698e-2f0d-416c-9401-f3995eb13234	2	Fit perfectly but came in creased in half on one end so the choker is permanently bend out of shape and looks ugly and damaged in that one spot.
779112f6-073a-40bb-908e-514829d4ae1f	5	Nice ring<br />Solid built
063a89ac-dd7b-416c-885d-03e55c89d0aa	5	Love them.
ce603435-ce39-4ae8-bce2-c2a510fdee00	5	Arrived on time and is just as pictured. I have yet to take it off.
ae0fa17c-9ffb-4071-9fc6-956fc9876005	2	The pin is pretty, but the center red stone is severely off center.  It is as if it were glued on and slid 1/2 way off.  I don't know how that could have gone unnoticed.  I'm afraid if I pull the stone off to re-set, it will remove the stone's backing.
dc03bcf1-46c0-4ea9-8da1-36cfe52070aa	5	This ice cream maker is super easy to operate and I am so very pleased with how fast and good it freezes ice cream. I love that there is no mess with ice and salt!  I feel, your recipe will determine how hard or soft your ice cream ends up.  I used a recipe that I got years ago from milnot milk and it froze very nicely.  I was able to dip it and it hold shape by the time it was frozen!  You can see the ice cream churning and getting thick.  I like that I can add choc chips, nuts, coconut, or such towards the end through the opening in the lid... and the added bonus for me is being able to sneak a spoonful while it is freezing.  I read reviews about it being loud... I do agree-- it is loud, but it's worth it!  I like that it makes a small batch when it's just for me and my husband, but I do wish I could buy it in a bigger size too to use for family gatherings. You can buy extra bowls to keep in the freezer and make one batch after the other, but that doesn't serve everyone fresh ice cream at the same time.  I have to mention that I did buy some of the 6 oz tovolo ice cream containers to freeze leftovers in. While 6 oz may seem small, it is a nice portion to satisfy a sweet tooth without a ton of calories! When you are ready to eat one of them, the silicone lid stays soft and comes off easy.  If you let the ice cream set at room temp for just a few minutes (maybe 4-5 min) your spoon will dip in more easily.  I have even microwaved it for 10 seconds and that works great too.  I highly recommend this Ice Cream Maker... we use ours often!
5af384ff-31f8-4b20-96f1-d09c200e8877	5	Really happy with these ice molds. They work exactly as advertised, and I really enjoy having a chilled glass of bourbon without the drink being totally watered down by regular ice cubes.
fbb206f2-47b2-4ff6-b069-8428465d71fa	1	Most unreliable product I have ever used
a1023de8-b11f-4d96-9b0a-ace772ad6649	5	Perfect size, anodizing seems to be good quality! Very nice product for the money!
fc49957a-cae4-4324-8dac-e2a722880011	3	Looks exactly like picture, glitter is a little messy but it served its purpose!
0f2e9567-3cbb-4faf-8911-48dd972d9da9	5	A++
18cbcb38-a63c-4d87-8014-82d5c71fad84	5	Very happy with it
fd1f13fa-dd4a-467c-bdec-0e21fd60c1b2	4	Beautiful nose ring I order an 18 gauge which is what I wear, but I seems a lil long to me, although it hasn't come out.. Over all it's beautiful!!!!!
79dde4d8-3aa1-4b82-9a33-302e2be542f0	5	Very good
69918764-0326-4f9a-a6bc-62ce4c4fc40d	5	Seems very nice, easy to use. Not as big as expected, though.  Storage pouch smells like fresh tar so that will be discarded.
c5fed535-af63-465f-bdce-116446304c75	5	Absolutely beautiful.  I was very surprised how shiny and nicely made this bracelet is.  It makes such a nice gift also.
1d11ce64-6fa7-4f3d-9d54-750211e4c4fe	5	Perfect and neat!
3928466a-f794-4952-803b-57687685b694	5	Best thing ever it usually takes me a long time to finish my cereal so the fact that I can keep it from getting soggy is the best great product
4066d298-8da2-4d3d-900d-af3606c834a6	5	Love it and arrived quickly! Thank you!
9bd5b50f-b2ea-47d9-8ae8-351aefbac7f4	5	I love the Keurig system and have been using it for so long now at work, at my leasing office, at other people's events. I finally got my own and it is a gem to have- quick, easy, convenient, reliable, and i love that you can brew any type of coffee you want (preferably starbucks). It is just so handy! And it helps me stay awake, stay focused, and get my day or night going depending on what type of work I have to do. I would 100% recommend anyone to buy this machine, and keep the love for coffee and tea alive! Also,Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!
0170b1d0-af6c-43f5-a9c7-e368f84582d6	5	I read all the reviews.  There is nothing wrong with this item.  It is what it is and saying that its just a described it works great, I'm using it for more than just making Jelly I'm not a avid cook and its just great for me,  don't know what other people were expecting.  I'm very pleased.  Came with other items but still came early.
8acba203-c023-4681-8161-ef6eadff9146	2	If fits well with the machine, but, it makes such a horrible noise. I have to put paper around the base so it would make a quiter noise. Also, for a brand new item, its all scratch and looks foggy on the top.  I had to ship it to my best friend's house in Florida in order to get it here to Puerto Rico.  Honestly, noth worth a $100.00 dollars.
66b030d6-eb0a-4409-aea2-31e474c3740b	5	Perfect. Fast. Love the color. Still working after 2 years (used two times per days)
b6c622ea-ade6-4305-b6ab-8174bd47b0fd	5	escelent
57898d01-775a-4431-ab89-6d597a4f4f0b	1	Wasted my money, the first time I worn it , it fell apart and started changing color  immediately I know it was cheap but OMG in a few hours and gone not even a week I got to use it.
ae61e9c7-000f-4e3a-9460-a9312bc152eb	1	Made my belly button super infected and it started rejecting, I had to take it out and now I have a gross scar. Don't put colored metal in your belly before a year. The shape of the ring was so weird too.
30e4b35b-9129-47fc-afec-973862bf1a9b	5	These are so beautiful and I love to wear them. The silver is etched clearly and the contrasting black makes the earrings the only jewelry you need to wear.
a6a0db46-fb69-47a3-846a-c7800c05b035	5	This is a good piece of necklace. Wont' lose it. Thanks!
18ddc4bc-f7a3-4a99-bf63-80454b150f33	4	I think this was a great product with some flaws, I tried a zucchini, and in the end it worked great however it was hard to get it to stay on the prongs, and get it going to slice.  The blades are sharp and it is better then the hand held version.  I thought it was difficult to stabilize the fruit while pushing and turning the handle to cut.  I wouldn't say it is a loss though and will use this again and again.  I am sure once I get the hang of it it will be much easier. So dependng on what you want to use it for, I do recommend this product!
60a48004-f59c-4c3f-aabe-4857317fdaf2	5	I first did a very negative review of this product thinking they were way too small for my bread machine bread. However, I just realized that I had not opened the bag completely. They are perfect! I am so happy to have found a bag big enough for bread machine bread. Sorry if my first post made you had orate to order.
c2c30f6a-1a33-42a0-b72e-912931a97da5	5	Very share
b795dfcd-76bf-4cec-8c00-2a6d8f95ea44	5	These are even more beautiful in person.They shine and sparkle and look so beautifully vintage. They come with bullet clutch earring backs. They have stayed in with no problems. This photo doesn't do them justice. If you are looking for something unique and special, these are it!<br /><br />**I received these for a discount in exchange for my unbiased review**
c37e9681-022b-4923-a838-3746dc30827f	5	5 stars, looks just like the  picture and fast delivery thank you
cf9e68d0-7a62-4d0b-b051-886cca76d093	5	Very well made and does an excellent job and is easy on my hands.  I have arthritis and do not have a lot of strength in my hands any more.  I plan on hand washing to maintain the beautiful finish although it indicates dishwasher safe.  I shopped for quite awhile and chose this one pacifically because the handles do not  totally chose together which helps because closing my hand is difficult anymore.  I also like the larger bowl sometimes lemons can be quite large.
031fd19f-48a8-4923-b886-bca54d643465	2	It is pretty to look at and sturdy.  However, the garlic chamber is a little small (holds only one clove at a time) and the handles have seams which allow them to fill with water when you wash it.  I love OXO, so it won't stop me from trying and buying other products, but if I had known these two things about this garlic press, I wouldn't have ordered it.
24566674-58a7-422d-9033-b005bd86594e	5	love it!
0a7e6948-85fc-4292-9f8d-df22ccb541a2	2	Kind of cheap looking and looks more like a cherry.
052fdb81-f4a9-4b0a-a913-2763be6546b2	1	When an item is so heavy you have to ask your husband to help you take it out of the box, you know already that this is not something you are going to enjoy using in your kitchen!<br />OK, maybe I should have read the fine print more carefully, but would anyone expect a grill that the cook is expected to position over stove burners and clean up manually afterwards to weigh 19 pounds? That may have been my fault, but I did read enough to reassure myself from the Amazon page that the grill was dishwasher safe; the manual, however, says to wash by hand with mild detergent, like most cast-iron.<br />I had hoped to use this grill in my oven as an adjunct to the normal broiler pan, but it is JUST too wide to do so. I started to slide it into the oven, but it was scraping the sides of the oven,so I desisted.  Its surface is rough enough that I fear it is also likely to scratch my glass cooktop, and the rough surface, large size, and weight make me also think it may scratch my sink when I clean it.<br />If I were big and strong, I think this might be a nice accessory for my outdoor grill, but it is not something I am willing to use in my kitchen. Sorry, Rick, no me gusta.
6b6a4006-f1c0-4648-acf7-6d8f73f5c3bc	5	I love it!!!! it is not cheep medal and it arrived on time and im really satisfied with the product!!!!!
8694795b-258f-47e1-bf54-c12d1c8629d1	5	Fit perfect! Exactly what I want and now I've ordered 5 more sets from urban body jewelry
05f10bb4-aea1-4808-8c9f-ca1feaa6687e	2	Pretty, but the straight wire looks cheap & feels flimsy. Made me sad.
508381f2-d295-46fd-87da-ec16cb5c2f1a	5	well worth it!
2069df2f-d8a4-4da6-9c41-80b3d34ae07e	5	My daughter loved this so much when it arrived.  She wears it in her wrist! Is is well made and beautiful.

b3e45891-65b2-40d6-84a7-7adc26b5d5b5	3	I love this little bracelet, it did turn my arm green though after the first wearing. :( So I can only give it about three stars. It is super cute, but needs to be coated.
75c68af6-bfde-4f38-9bc6-fe65e6b0921c	3	I am disappointed in these earrings.  They are much smaller than expected and they look sort of glued together.  The part that is supposed to be mother of pearl looks rather like plastic up close.  Since I got them for only $34.00 I kept them.  They are not bad, just not nearly as nice as I expected for their original price of about $100.00.
3729140e-8b82-409b-beda-709d66d3a5ee	5	All pieces are great .! I like to switch my tongue rings out cause after a while they tend to get kinda nasty. You really can't beat the price on this .! And I love the designs. There is at least one thing for everyone .!
0876e7a7-8ede-4451-8ae1-c8e10b20dcdd	4	wasn't sure if i would like it so i brought it to a beach rental as the knives are always dull and of medium to low quality.  It did a nice job sharpening up a set of Faberware knives with a little time.  Good purchase, works well!
888d4ae7-b04e-4584-a302-76e2dcaa1cb6	5	good

7d71af97-8409-4851-ab0e-7dd7ec53e0e4	5	Great addition to the Big Berkey.  This stand makes it so easy to put filtration system anywhere I want on my counter and put the glass right under the spout to fill 'er up!
b751a1be-2473-4144-853e-ce1f867c1189	5	Love it!! The chain is so delicate and the pendant is so pretty!!!
677cfb18-46c6-4770-b481-a60eb2b49dc1	5	Well made and durable.
53490736-3f8b-4212-9698-afc6a9819c58	5	Absolutely beautiful necklace and earrings. Thank you so much. Exactly what I wanted
e9430d61-117e-4578-a6e6-3037e9112fef	5	This is a very beautiful necklace. The pendant is smaller than pictured, but is still large enough to be seen and look classy without being &#34;gaudy&#34;  The sterling silver box chain is nice, but I prefer a slightly longer chain, so I replaced it with one I already had. The pearl, as well as the other stones are securely fastened in place, with no sign of adhesive or fasteners.  The stones are very tight as well.  I think this is a lovely piece of jewelry, and I would not think twice about purchasing another piece of jewelry from this company.

dddf4365-a160-49d4-b229-d7bde498db4e	5	My wife and I were looking for reusable straws after we acquired iced coffee addictions and were burning through regular straws. I was unsure how I'd like using a silicone straw but after doing a simple wash as instructed they worked great and didn't have any sort of plasticky taste.The fact that they separate at the curve is also brilliant and makes them super easy to clean.<br /><br />Can't wait to buy more as gifts for family and friends!
69a36c2b-7250-4308-9661-3776076d7353	5	thanks - good item

ab476964-1b81-4aa5-91fd-5af1eaea0a42	4	I just love my juicer. This was the first juicer that I purchased. It works well. Cleaning could be a little easier but other than that it works great. Juices  everything I love. You must cut your fruit in smaller pieces with this juicer.
fb09b323-5b04-4bb3-9f08-30c6f8e63e9c	5	Great product love it, would buy another
7a8408f1-8234-4372-b1e6-bbcc9bb744c9	5	These come in real handy for visitors make up some and keep on hand.Of course I use mine up when I'm lazy and don't want to make up a cup then wash it and put it away just use and toss.
1e7a9da5-e0bd-4830-9637-99799c54ea2b	5	I've used this bottle several times already and I really like. Great bottle for the price. I noticed that some customers stated that their bottle leaks, I haven't had that problem. I done all the leak test i could think of but mine doesn't leak. If you have a problem with leaks when you first get it make sure the lid is on properly. I will be ordering another bottle soon.
6b21f9c0-6d36-4f2d-aac5-7bdc2731c36d	1	It broke the first week i had it....
7c705f28-80aa-4d3a-a4c5-1a6a9d0f1384	5	Item as decribed and adorable!!!
bc51bfc6-c3e1-478b-ab29-1c34c576c8db	4	So far so good. Just have to be careful as there is a learning curve to opening and shutting them if the contents is even a little melted. I think maybe 8 and up could handle it in a lunchbox.
2e06b8bc-fd6d-4dc0-a364-82ab4abb2689	4	The thickness of the top doesnt allow the Keurig to close nicely, but it functions well.  What I like the best is that I no longer have to monkey with the stupid sensor that gave me grief when I used my other k-cups.  I just finished my first cup of joe from the k-cup and aside from adjusting my brew strength over the next couple of cups, it is ideal.<br /><br />FOR THOSE WONDERING, APPARENTLY THE MANUFACTURER DID SOMETHING WITH THE COLOR DIE IN THE TOP OF THE K-CUP THAT TELLS THE SENSOR THIS IS AN OFFICIAL K-CUP FOR A 2.0 MACHINE.  THIS IS PERFECT!
aaae85ef-83ee-4deb-b6f6-f72be1b4b612	5	i love it
a5d78c4b-a48b-4efb-9dac-bdc2659f501e	5	I think these are very pretty earrings, and appear to be well made.
d291f359-d8c1-47a1-a745-ddecc3b27dc6	5	This is a very pretty bracelet and looks just like the picture.
174856b8-e940-488f-8b60-338d181f144b	4	Beautiful copper  but the wrist straps are a bit flimsy.  Love it though and it looks great.
3fee491b-b845-4d7c-9301-80d5fb854db8	5	This is my second one of these...my son took the first one for his new condo.  One of the secrets of really good coffee...it needs to be hot!  Great coffee maker!!
d8237ff3-05d0-4a4d-acc4-5690b11a0b74	4	Very nice earrings and great price. 10 yr old daughter loves them.
3a99b893-e7b0-4602-876a-5b31edc3bb02	5	I lost a one of a kind Tree of Life ring and was pleased to find this similar ring.  Great buy and a perfect meaning.
8dc0b64c-7f2c-4576-b129-4f1a867bf3be	4	Smaller than thought but quality charm
81ca1b53-c347-4741-a230-9571465d9b11	4	Heavy-duty ice cream scoop made in the USA, hip hip hurray. It is weighty and sturdy. FYI, the &#34;color&#34; indicates the size of the scoop. It has nothing to do with coordinating with your kitchen. Blue is 3 ounces times two scoops for you and me, and everybody is happy as a clam. NOTE: as instructions clearly state. Do NOT wash in dishwasher. I have other similar aluminum ice cream scoopers and have never had an issue with corrosion.
9bb2c221-e16f-4d78-bad8-9048db4e62a7	5	I got this for my mom and she loves it.
9d3a40ef-994c-4cb3-b49c-10292583a639	5	A winner, my wife liked it.
3195b911-42af-4b26-a965-4f017a8ee566	2	Very nice, but broke almost immediately
52170b3d-1355-4143-8e56-60a6a9769743	5	I'm so happy with this purchase.  It is more beautiful in person.  Good quality.  I did buy a different chain.  I needed it to be a bit longer & more sturdy.  I had difficulty getting the cremains in using the funnel, so I used to spoon provided & carefully &#34;poured&#34; them in.  This necklace holds a lot so be patient.  Shipping was fast.

e9c5886f-3436-4ca4-b90a-d943fd856654	4	As someone who loves to cook in the kitchen and enjoys a nice poached egg, I was eager to try the Silicone Egg Poacher 4 Pack by Kitchen Essentials.  I have never tried anything like this before, so I was excited to see how it worked out.I like that all of the egg stays in the silicone cup and I don't lose any in the pot like I normally do. Nothing stuck and they were easily cleaned with soap and water. I put wooden skewers through the holes to keep it stable on the rim of the simmering water and melted some chocolate too.  I am going to try other ways to use these egg poachers.  I think they are really nice and work good.  I received this product in exchange for a review. All my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.

e87b1b1b-0a57-4c9a-9982-ab060bdaa975	5	This is my favorite ring! I have had it for about two years and barely ever take it off. It is very sturdy, awesome details and I get a lot of compliments for it!
f282686b-f210-467d-b7db-46b2e950e957	5	Excellent Item
29f72764-6d3e-49af-bada-a6bb9a445e22	5	I really like this bottle. Very well made, and the wide body construction makes it easy to clean.
7a10a71a-8b06-4eb7-b33b-a88d6b3e92c5	5	I used to gaze at the fancier bottles of wine in my collection yearning to drink them, but completely befuddled as to how to find the bottle's cork.  I knew the cork was hiding somewhere underneath the shiny metal foil firmly affixed to the bottle neck, shimmering like an elusive mirage.  However, attempts to remove this stubborn oenophilic chastity belt with a knife or a scissors proved futile, and on one occasion practically fatal.  While awaiting paramedics to arrive after severing a major artery and collapsing face down in a puddle of my own blood, I vowed to never again risk my own life attempting to remove another dastardly wine foil.<br /><br />And so I was sadly relegated to drinking screw-top bottles of wine, doomed to live a pathetic, solitary life.  I soon learned that nobody wants to be with a man who only drinks screw top or boxed wines; that's no a man, that's a child.  Feeling hopeless and lonely, I decided to cash in my life savings and move to Minsk where I could spend the rest of my days drowning my sorrows in bottles of vodka with easily removable caps.<br /><br />In a shocking twist of fate, on the morning of the day I was set to leave on a one-way flight to Minsk with no possibility of return, I happened upon an advertisement for a life-saving product called Edgy.  Edgy provides a safe, reliable way to remove wine foils with no messes and no accidents.  Now, the fancy bottles of wine that used to mock and taunt me are crushed like ladybugs.  I guzzle Domaine Leflaive Montrachets, Screaming Eagle Cabernets, and Henri Jayer Richebourg Cotes de Nuits like bottles of water, all thanks to Edgy.  Yes, I am now drunk literally all of the time, but I'm also happily married (I think) to a woman (I think) who is stunningly beautiful (I think).  And it's all because of Edgy.<br /><br />So thank you, Edgy, for saving my life.
7bbc7e4c-dcfc-429d-97de-df378cc2d354	5	Works great! Cannot see any difference in the popular name brand and these.
d01d3dff-aa01-4200-b262-83be531533a0	4	a little bigger than i had imagined.but well made.
e20198f2-00a3-4bb2-8c47-9a028ae1c00c	5	This is the best home vacuum sealer on the market! Bar None! I have given my Food Saver to the Goodwill.
dc1899d8-d879-4a5b-b729-b9f711e01a36	1	I chose to overlook the fact that this is NOT A ROLLO CHAIN, as stated in the description and as shown in the photo.  That was my first mistake.  Anyway, after initial inspection, I put the necklace, unworn, back into the box, where it sat for almost two months (long story).  When I removed it from the box to wear it today, it had TARNISHED IN THE BOX, UNWORN!!!<br /><br />This vendor is not sending the product it promised and the product that is being sent is of grossly inferior quality.  Do yourself a favor and do not waste your time or money.
d4f9b6d1-5d01-45c5-a279-74a47faa4bd7	5	Excellent quality and shipping. Very pleased with the product.  Many of may fellow Masons would enjoy the ring.
f12a7e5d-2266-49cd-a684-835044185bcf	5	but the string wont last...
031d882a-b949-4b4e-8b99-ff4857d387c6	5	Love it
14b9303d-f778-4a07-99aa-57558145e08e	5	1st use produced a very nice, well browned and juicy bird. Added potato and onion to the tray and they cooked up very nicely. I've used it both on the grill and in the oven...works equally well. Order of magnitude better than fussing with beer cans or pedestals. Recommend it......it's worth the investment.
142b538f-388f-4e8e-a9fd-608e3d622790	3	Liked the rice cooker, but the cords can get in the way and the paddle holder could also be better designed.  I sure wished it was retractable cord.  Small convience can go a long way in higher rating.
bd86820f-0927-48f4-9180-ea6a83b8ae34	4	I like the drawers because it keeps the coffee cups organized and conserves space. Overall looks nice, only complaint is the drawers. They are a little loose but overall still a good purchase.
7775b562-d669-413a-9057-08d9ab152c6d	5	love this ring! wear it during cold season to insure my diamond engagement ring wont fall off...
e67d74c1-86f1-40ee-b233-d8f70307b55e	1	Just bad! sent it back to Mfg!
4e696a07-2b61-405e-8ff9-b11a5361dff3	5	Perfect!
f8fca6de-c39d-477f-a4fd-b4da20c6db32	5	This is my 2nd one as I accidentally broke the first (Christmas Gift). Very well made, and works very well hot chocolate.
b82de19b-725c-4b21-ac97-510cd21ff62e	5	It was exactly what I wanted. Easy to clean, easy to use, and pink! Which is important.
8dc8b0d1-f093-425c-b697-ab56fdd17683	5	This is the perfect wine preserver.
011a4841-6338-4a19-8acc-a6ccbdefc409	5	So pretty and sparly. While I think maybe the necklace might be a bit much, I have my eye on the matching bracelet.
53564ce9-c101-4ddb-ad4e-e8a7e7c41734	1	This juicer is actually really terrible! I read a lot of reviews and ended up getting this one. Had it a couple years and find it just is not useful. The small feed tube requires you to spend a lot of time prepping before you can actually juice. And this juicer does NOT does well with squishy fruit. Forget about juicing pineapple... it does not work. Anything squishy does not get pushed through the matiscator and you have to empty out the entire assembly to continue juicing. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who actually wants to juice regularly. You will spend way to much time for the whole process.
f0f3dcb2-aad7-4729-b5fb-3888dc932441	5	it is every ting and more
95421457-f542-434e-aff0-cdd634437e7a	2	Too small

29449dfb-fbbb-4001-bef6-8fff102f53f7	5	Great Knife I use it a lot.
aa06e4ef-4809-4f3f-bcee-7b730344f4a6	5	I use this awesome bag as a handbag! Love it!
83d4a69b-28a6-4178-bb8d-cec15cf28564	5	This has been so easy to use and accurate. Love it.
605497c8-cb86-47cc-ae22-a00913446d88	1	Do not buy!  The coating peeled off on the first use...So much for doing gravy with the drippings!
e15cbf0f-be0f-4c6c-8ffe-7460e1f3cfa9	5	Very cute!
b8a82a12-7ea1-4c3f-946c-e27c9edb5295	5	This unit replaces a sqeezo that had been in my family for 40 years, works great. Easy cleanup. I also bought the  4 piece accessory kit for salsa<br />and berry sleeve(Jam).
110d2ecb-6887-4113-b13a-038fb60d7c07	5	Smaller then it looks in the pic but just the right size for Pre-K!
b5688331-6972-4ddc-8b18-8469ed2c76e1	5	I absolutely love my bracelet. I wear it every day. It means the world to me. Thank you to the holy land souvenir. I am looking to buy another one but I will see it's no longer available right now. Do you know if this item will be selling again?
6e3328b3-6458-49d3-b643-d0744f3bd949	5	This product is fantastic.  I was wary of the hype in the description but it is very simple to use and I sharpened all of my knives in a  few minutes - and they are VERY sharp - like new.  Its hard to tell from the picture that this sharpener is less than 3 inches wide and tall, so it fits easily in my knife drawer.
18377530-2a79-4ec8-aaf3-41b04560be89	4	The chain and bar are delicate and cute! The bar itself is approximately 2 inches wide. The only issue I've seen on myself so far is that sometimes the bar portion doesn't lie horizontally, but scoots up to be diagonal. It's cute and I would order another one!
8cb374ae-c8b9-4d12-913f-96f6499e8113	5	Super handy
80557652-ac83-48b5-b0bb-2e48a89ae0c6	5	After a month, I like the container a lot. It can hold one pound of whole coffee beans. It seems to keep the coffee fresh..The opener works smoothly.
88e66a00-273c-4e9a-aa8f-67fe0d9b3782	5	very well made. Makes good size popsicles.
45dd273c-5ac4-43dc-8ed6-d30d108eb293	1	One of these broke when I tried to lightly adjust the size
6a1dad68-0f5b-4189-9281-74a7f8d21ff8	5	Love it, just perfect.
84d4c7ab-04a4-4138-b21f-a5cbe2bbdbeb	3	I ordered two of these cups expecting assorted colors, instead I received two of the exact same colors so that was a little disappointing.  So.....it's just ok.
16ecc692-3d65-4b40-898f-563df4cd2bfd	4	Great!
b5ca790c-b8f1-4daf-9bf4-7463bc4544a9	5	Absolutely love this product. Works great with the food saver. I make fresh juice and salads in wide mouth jars and using this sealer allows it to stay fresh for about a week.
a60c3e9d-79b8-4ffe-9a97-97d2e00b15ff	5	When I first got these, I noticed the awesome gift box they came in. Then, inside were 4 individually wrapped packages of ear rings. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I love that they are hinged and they have a locking clasp so they don't accidently fall out of your ears. I have been wearing these for 2 days now and they are lightweight and beautiful. They go with anything I could wear them with and they are sturdy enough for me to wear them 24/7 and not have to worry about taking them out at night.<br />*I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review*
c7e8149a-8310-4d5f-b22d-ec5cd0f64047	5	Get the tank and have it replaced from a diy home brew shops
7912e691-ce7e-4492-a127-795716e8fd4d	1	I never got the product to work.
1f647b89-0044-4c1f-a1ea-61ec37b3a535	3	The cord began to unravel after wearing it for four days.
0c515d16-798d-4e48-8eca-8acc13ad1658	5	Can't believe how fast I can get my berries ready now. I have the stem puller and now this to slice. Makes everything so fast. The blades are stainless steel and very sharp…..built very well. Worth the money. Being 71 and my hands are stiff from arthritis this really helps me a lot.
2c4d326e-4c7a-4c10-87c4-3e2e428aef33	1	These containers are absolute garbage. We bought two, after 2 months the lid for the first one had a crack running down the centre, after 3 months the second one has multiple cracks. We're left with two bottoms, and no workable lids, unless you want Styrofoam in your food.
9609ec6f-211b-448a-a373-4bc78098560f	5	Great movie! great condition
0a5409ad-a8c0-4606-bf8d-6faefa57fd05	3	Very easy to use turned out great.
3bcf812f-fe88-4b61-883d-fa600f3ee484	1	Was broken when I got it!! Waste of money!
f9a0dfd2-4032-4858-80ac-63d53496e48c	5	Really cute, the back screw does come off here and there, but is my super active toddler who has them on.
9e7d6cc6-c62d-49ad-b96f-b4e30d198a2e	5	I have a necklace with the same color pattern, so I got these to go with-so happy, works well!
2ea0ca0b-dac8-4a08-a749-a3fa040960ec	5	Love how fast it works!  Not to loud and my daughter loves the smoothies we make with it!
bd54b369-254a-4602-afa3-150994297432	3	It was not a hit pink that i wanted and the jewl broke out after wearing it for a month. I didnt like it as well as i thought i would.
9cebb8f0-d861-4e6b-bb59-07b89d6da906	1	Terrible
685a2b73-3aec-4d49-9f89-8bc4077f5924	3	Got them way faster than expected I was content with the product only thing is the color is lighter than the picture I wanted dark gauges
35b9d104-3db6-48df-b3bb-10bc54fbd7cf	4	they were exactly what I was looking for...and they were shipped to us so quick.  Thanks,
7fe242ac-e844-4dfe-bfce-bde7f20b0c59	4	love it!
9ff710f7-896c-44b8-b379-9c2db5ea42e8	4	These are really pretty. However, if you have nipples bigger then a pencil eraser, this will not fit very well. It is cheap metal and will break if you bend it to roughly.
afadf913-abd4-436a-8ca8-270cb7eb404d	1	Unit leaked out of top spout and cap was very difficult to remove. returned for a refund
de48d136-7df1-4dc8-8410-18f0a97813cd	5	brand new and received free coasters
281fb66f-8395-4cf1-9072-8064bc58d9cc	4	Very pretty, fits well
0c967875-3a6f-4aeb-b922-42c5a185aa94	5	Very happy with this purchase. The water quality where we live isn't the best, it tastes horrible! After reading all the reviews between Pur and Brita, we decided on the Pur due to its high rankings, ability to clean and great tasting water. And we couldn't be happier with our choice. This is a great choice! It's slim profile takes up minimal room in the fridge while holding substantial water. The quality of the water is amazing, it tastes great! Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.
71b6e072-1597-4368-9ae9-f9204ce3acdb	5	I love mood jewelry. I put the charm on a plain silver necklace and wear it just about everyday. I've never had a problem with mood jewelry changing colors and this one is no different. The colors are beautiful and I love wearing it.
0d7a1277-c653-4ebb-8524-2467712357ea	4	Beautiful  !!! I love it Thank you :) ♡♡♡♡
6247ac9f-ccf5-4df9-beac-e9af54d86ac0	5	Really works great
13daf93c-ce61-4004-85ab-6c88c9f30279	5	I was blown away by this device.  I expected something good, but received something beyond my expectations.  We've used this wok several times and have been totally satisfied with the results, each time.
58306131-9591-4793-b05f-eb98b7daa3a9	5	great. Came quick and was very inexpensive
022ec213-2d13-41d0-b98c-0baf04d8e3d5	5	I have purchased 2 of these so far. I like them so much, will go back and buy lots more for gifts and for myself.
06517fdf-b7b0-4055-bee5-e45bd8c6bfef	5	It was exactly what he wanted. A snug fit and the correct size. I bought for my other half. He loves it. Delivery was very good and received in a timely manner.
e8a5850d-9849-48c8-a44f-9585a6923aa9	4	Works great! Fits well in the fridge. The only reason it lost a star is that the bottom is not perfectly flat, which makes it rock some, which could be a disaster if bumped.
a96ad8d7-01f2-4c1a-b429-2dd9c6b06476	5	I was so excited to get this infuser bottle I couldn't wait. I love that the bottle has a lid to it that opens and closes. Its convenient to carry and has a rubber grip to the sides so it doesn't slip when it gets wet. Its durable to spills of any kind and best part is it holds 32 oz of water!!! The infuser is great and stores a large amount of any fruit to your liking. I will tell many of my friends and family to purchase this item!<br />*disclaimer item was purchased at a low cost amount in return for a honest nonbiased review
d17a38d6-058c-4861-b6d3-934517c7c909	5	Used for a baby shower cake.  Made white and pink out of choocolate.. looked like real buttons!  Adorable!

a0321e36-efcc-4073-9f85-69092180e9ed	1	complete crap. Massively disappointed by this pathetically flimsy and extremely feminine necklace. chain is suuuuuper thin and literally broke as I put it on the first time.....
2019d0bf-b31d-4ad4-acb8-2657ff6db3c5	5	These were a gift the recipient loved them. They are beautiful in person and add a touch of magic to everyday life!
4dba88e1-ac67-42c4-80f6-8dd3d449dd71	5	The best little pan for frying up 1 perfectly shaped egg, and with a glass lid over it even if it doesnt fit perfectly, and low heat, I can even cook the top side of it as well with the steam trapped under the lid..<br />Love this !!!
163c0493-3b32-4bd1-8eb1-367c0d0e3039	5	Great to hv

e8dc5827-49b5-490d-9259-3f77425d2b2f	5	If you use wooden spoons and spatulas in your kitchen, and you should be.  Viable Creations culinary set is the best I have owned. This is a very nice set, they are heavy duty, very well-made, and they feel good in your hands- both ergonomic and smooth.<br />I’ve been using them for all of my cooking needs and I’m completely happy about my purchase. You will not be disappointed with the quality of this set. I’m also impressed with Viable Creations customer service, very professional and helpful with questions I had about maintaining the spoons. Hand wash with mild soap and apply olive oil or a food safe oil occasionally to keep them looking new.<br /><br />I highly recommend this company and this bamboo set. 5 out of 5 stars.

60327006-34da-4c88-9b22-038b5b286eec	5	I don't like using foil too much, it seems wasteful, but I use this when I'm in a hurry and don't want a lot of clean up.  It really cuts down on scrubbing/soaking time when I roast vegetables.  Roasted squashes, potatoes, or other root veggies, just slide off. Even aspargus with parmesan, the browned cheese slides off for a pretty serving and no scrubbing afterwards.
94a47aff-7a93-494f-8f40-2eab54454e95	5	I'm mildly allergic to surgical steel, so this has been in my conche for a solid 4 months.  Every now and then a ball will fall off when I'm cleaning my ear, but that's to be expected with any jewelry.
802f6d9c-614b-4f16-838a-73c7d98dfa21	2	Looks very cheesy I wouldn't purchase again
36fff17d-3edb-4c54-8687-2070b05510d2	5	Nice size Mandoline. Cuts like a dream and is easy to use. Have wanted one for a long time and now I have one. I would recommend this to any one wanting a very good product and the price was right .
f5c79205-9269-4fcd-86b5-4267ae7af93c	5	You will have to adjust the settings to make larger amounts of liquid but I just hit the button twice, for Example if I want a Macchiato I let it go thru it's cycle and then I hit the button on the coffee side, the largest one (i forgot the name of it) its does not change the flavor at all!! Great machine! Oh and the milk is not cold going thru. but if you like it hotter just do the milk cleaning first and it will make are the parts the milk goes thru, hot.
14ff5559-eb57-4f93-bd91-4aeba852f312	5	Great Coffee maker. Better than competitiors
a4b96feb-5a11-4209-bc7c-5f088dfc3a4b	1	Poor quality. Requested  refund.
7712a1ec-0fbc-45b4-98ad-a8874f775fc9	5	I love this set and I'm considering ordering another.  I ordered these to compliment my ceramic plates from Pier 1. They are so sturdy, that they seem like ceramic.  The small bowls were much smaller than expected, though, maybe only hold 2 tablespoons.
037329a0-0954-427a-a707-6dfd58bb5044	5	Very small but pretty. They are light weight and look very nice.
1de3492d-25a8-47ba-8160-c191fe671881	5	Very pretty pendant though the chain it comes on is flimsy.
9805d0d9-1519-4222-8af2-4df43d7d7b27	5	My girlfriend loves it !! It's very beautiful, great craftsmanship!
7be2d9b9-c7e1-48c3-aa23-83950cb2129e	5	I've comes out so easily. Does the trick

56c4600d-cced-4aef-bf15-a23ddec388f1	4	Ver y nice disgn and nice cut,... But the black metal changes color quickly!! But still a nice product
1d8d6ae5-fb0d-4dbc-b74c-94ffa839d779	1	The ring I not 925 it started changing colors.
d1e92bcd-d3d2-4d8b-97f4-c171d85ac5df	5	While I usually like my necklaces a tad bigger than this, it turns out I was won over by this necklace just the way it was. It is really so beautiful and eye-catching! It doesn't seem to matter that it is synthetic. It is equally as lovely as the earrings I got to match that were real.
6f7ba9e7-60c9-4c6f-b672-3265d93310de	5	These earrings are even nicer in reality. They are lightweight and comfortable as well as attractive. Simple, yet elegant.
d2d3e3ed-e6ff-4829-85d5-20ad40ae9663	5	Awesome
abb75a7e-86b8-43be-9eb2-6f8e5ba25c3f	3	poor quality, but it did work for like 2 years until it fell apart entirely

fdf56656-1016-485f-a3bf-79da1aeafe6a	1	Too hard to screw and unscrew broke the post trying to get them off. But they are cute for the price
faf7f15e-80c8-45b2-9b69-4e466894676e	5	Beautiful, and the wife really liked it.
cfbb8e61-d818-4bf6-9fc6-861068084631	5	Love it
d3f57ceb-38c8-471f-82fd-31d7f31579fc	3	This is a beautiful name bar chain except it did not come engraved. I filled out the part for the engraving, but it came with no name. I did not return it, I took it to a jeweler and had it engraved.
3de731d5-4854-42c2-b00e-37b50ef2b232	4	Very pretty and a great buy
46fdf467-f36d-4f3a-a4bf-3ba42aba50e8	5	Great size, great colors!
2b87b0cf-1f13-4574-b8a4-83773396ea5e	5	I bought 10 of these to present bracelets to my home EC class. They all loved it.

f76f7b8d-de62-4776-a77f-06352cf7acc0	5	Cute
7bdca966-7a40-4190-ae6c-e878f088f048	5	I loved my first bracelet so much that I ordered 3 more! I do have large wrists for a female so they are snug when closed but no doubt these will fit a &quot;average&quot; wrist just fine. I just wear mine open and layered them up and put a little spin on the traditional bangle style. I do have to say that the flower can get caught on things from time to time BUT these beauties have held up!
7e6eaffe-4e0a-4fcd-be65-528d18737ca1	5	These are wonderful tongs! I just used them for canning peach jam, and they were perfect in lifting lids and jars out of boiling water.
752b0d2c-adb6-4079-9af1-0fd9493090e3	3	This travel mug serves its purpose in preventing leaks and spills, but it is not my favorite. It works great to keep your coffee hot for about an hour, and I can honestly say that it had never leaked. The unique button-release design is a simple yet effective approach to quickly taking a swig of coffee without having to fuss with cumbersome latches. However, there are two problems with this mug that I have encountered over a few months of use. 1. The hole that the coffee comes out of is much too small and makes it very difficult to sip hot coffee without burning yourself. This is a stark contrast to my yetti mug, which I use for both hot and cold beverages. 2. The lip of the plastic lid that you place into your mouth has a rough, grainy sort of texture. I prefer a slick, smooth plastic that resembles something closer to the feel of glass. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase, and I received my mug in a timely fashion. But, this is not my go-to mug for coffee.
3fe82b84-1230-45e1-9e70-71408b111458	5	Beautiful wine stopper!!  Unique, because it is a functional 2-in-1 unit with the pourer and wine stopper.  Love it!  Would be a great gift or perfect Christmas stocking stuffer for your wine loving friends/family!!
95ed642c-6cb1-483f-99ae-a6937cb2b3fd	5	Great earrings. Nice weight. Fast delivery
7cf32b45-0d0c-4e97-8063-3b2c4af73ffe	5	I actually bought this to siphon grease out of the frying pan, when I'm cooking high fat meats, like hamburger and bacon.  It works like a charm and it cleans beautifully.  I use it often.  I've thrown it into the dishwasher - no fuss no muss.  Such a great kitchen tool!
266fc420-775c-48c9-b13d-ed455a51fc2f	5	Fits wrist perfectly.  Great material.  Nice!
149b3fcc-7fcc-455a-9161-3167a9bd9f1f	4	These earrings are beautiful - the colors are just as vibrant as the picture, they are well set and they look great in the box. So I was bummed when they didn't show off as nice on my ears. Everybody's ears are different, so I'm trying not to generalize, but on my ears, 2/3 of the earrings were off of my lobes and because of the weight, they sort of pull forward where the pin goes through and back at the bottom, so the earring hangs slanted backward. So people see more of the top of the setting, than the actual stones and it's hard to appreciate how pretty they are! I've never had this particular issue with earrings before, so I think they may be just slightly oddly weighted to look their best once they are in your ears. Still, the blues  are great and set off blue eyes really well and I'm sure for other people's ears they may look just as great in your ears as they do in the box.
6d593b63-17d9-47d8-82c9-43de8072fae1	4	Thought it was opal it's more like foggy clear. But it's cute
ea3ed858-3342-4128-91cb-7724f2348772	5	Using this for CP soap.  Nice 4.5 oz bar with tons of details.  Comes out of mold perfectly.  Mold is very pliable so be sure to have it on a sturdy board/tray if you plan on moving it after you pour them.
4252f1c2-c976-4ba4-966d-30d2eabda9e1	5	I run a RAOK (The Random Acts of Kindness) group on FB and one thing I send to people is scented wax. This has been a great help to help with sending wax
ebeb26cb-756a-4c60-a862-0d1f073832b5	5	Many comments love it , shows I stand with Christ .

4bf73b45-efdf-4626-952a-12441dde9de8	4	It ok what you see is what you get, nothing special.
0e114a73-5d8f-4aaf-980f-c0012acc3fd9	4	Nice size and fit perfectly. The black bands are removable so that you can clean under them.
5a0926db-e238-48e6-8d69-617a5d824c01	1	Does not make the job, bad quality.
5b6718e1-2602-4daa-bced-c38b25005e19	5	I've only had this cutting board for a few days but I am totally impressed. Doesn't slip on the counter, dishwasher friendly.  Hope it wears well.
c0ccd086-6c02-4126-adfc-ce752a58115f	1	The item was returned because the quality was very poor. Overpriced too!
7966cd84-00c1-42b1-b48c-c7c3369b489b	2	It is kind of hard to get the lids off of some of them and on the other hand, one of the lids didn't fit tightly enough and food spilled.
078f148e-1916-44fd-a7bf-e085af105329	5	I have had my K250 for about a month.  Before that I had the K40.  Both systems are very easy to use and make a great cup of coffee.  Coffee from a regular coffee maker doesn't seem to taste as good anymore. I would never go back to a regular coffee maker! The particular machine is very easy to use and the color options are great.  I personally have the turquoise and I love the colors vibrancy! I also love that this machine has an option to make your coffee stronger. I prefer to have the water reservoir to the side rather than the back of the machine. Having the reservoir to the side allows it to be removed easily for filling without having to move the machine each time or use a cup to fill it. I also wish it had an option to make the coffee hotter.  The temperature is good but adding cream definitely makes it a little cooler than I prefer.  Keurigs customer service is also impeccable.  I had pods that only worked with my old machine.  I called them and they replaced them for free and no questions asked!!! Overall this is an excellent machine for the cost.  I would buy it again and recommend it anyone!!! Keep up the good work Keurig!!!
8ff6533f-0dd9-44e4-a3b3-980abfb85edc	2	This coffee maker has doubled in price in one year so when you read the reviews you should consider that.  It makes coffee.  Period.  The lid leaks after putting in the dishwasher and I can't find a replacement carafe now.  It was fine for what I paid, but seriously. It just makes coffee like any other coffee maker.  I still have to heat it for 30 seconds for it to be hot enough for me just like I would any other normal coffee maker.
63db975b-931e-430d-94fe-5bfda6bf2b96	5	My wife bought these because she has sensitive ear and even the &#34;sensitive&#34; ear rings cause her ear lobes to swell.  These work great and no swelling.  We will be purchasing more stainless steel ear rings in the future
a4f82b2f-c7a5-48e0-aa60-83c58161745c	5	Lovely,very delicate color!
57dd90e3-bb58-4bce-a6de-d840095bccc2	5	This is a nice assortment. I have used it to figure out if I want to step up to pricier rings in sterling or gold. In the meantime, be sure to give these a good coating of clear nail lacquer because the metal will oxidize and turn your skin green...I am not complaining, understand, it goes with the territory.
c21b34f1-16c7-4bba-9fa0-619061a791c8	4	Christmas gift to myself last year.  Such a beautiful and highly functional kitchen tool. I have the Candy Apple Red and it's a stunner. Great addition to my kitchen arsenal.  I agree with the other reviewers on the cheap look and feel to the utensils.  Disappointing. I bought the mixing utensil with the rubber scraper blades on the edges from Amazon and highly recommend it.  Overall, this mixer blends and mixes most ingredients like a dream. I have not used the mixer heavily and when I do use it I tend to make cookie dough.  I have made pizza dough a couple of times and it's so amazing.<br /><br />The last two times I made cookie dough the motor audibly struggled after I added 2-1/4 cups of flour. I feel like this should not be happening.  Understandable maybe if I was making a double batch.  I'm hoping this isn't the start of a bigger problem. This along with the low quality of the utensils is why this item is rated 4 stars.<br /><br />I also bought the metal mixing bowl and highly recommend the pour shield.
e61740ef-1e2d-44f8-a836-07cb14410de0	4	nice little devise...aerator works well and rinses out easy.

51632de9-8e43-4ae3-82f5-dd9460bda197	1	The clasp doesn't hold nearly as well as some magnetic bracelets I have.
8622060e-bc75-4cbf-8910-6cc23bdb8fdf	5	If you are three best friends, this is the perfect gift to wear around your own neck and give to the two others. The metal looks like silver and the pendants are beautiful.
dd1c9b6c-c794-4987-b9d6-dc32d3772db4	5	Lovely pattern, nice thickness. These guest towels/napkins look beautiful when displayed. Set them out for guests and although I received a few compliments on them,  not a one was used. Very happy with this purchase.
e03711d9-e0f9-4fe3-9dfd-abbb67c690c1	5	Great juicer! I was skeptical of buying a juicer because i'd figured we wouldn't use it due to the pain of cleaning it.  I was wrong, we use it almost every day, it's easy to clean compared to most centrifuge juicers especially if you clean right after juicing, you can do a quick rinse of the parts and leave to dry.  The only caveat is leafy greens, they really make a mess inside the juicer mesh... Love this juicer!!!
8b7ddba1-5ad6-4cce-b86f-6436388d2ab9	4	Virtually brand new; Clean; Spotless; No smells or odors; However! mine have plastic instead of wire bails as shown in the picture - otherwise A-OK!
0cf5e80a-8251-4169-a1fb-a06aa2251e2d	5	Love the design of this mug.  Keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks as close to hot as you can get.
4ae031b9-7226-475b-9e27-9e069f35b7f8	5	very pretty nice design beautiful color to the stones . nice length.

3b7157b3-1aa9-4611-96e4-67b86349876e	5	Impressed the guests with a fancy cake. So easy to pop cake out and clean.
9c7577da-c2be-45f3-a75d-0dbfe6111969	1	Look elsewhere. Invested $200 in this oven and it stopped working in less than two years. I used it for heating up food less than 20 mins at a time on average three times a week. Contacted customer support and they offered to repair it for $99.00. I'll take my chances with a $50 oven at Target for now on.
5a7236c9-9beb-4718-9397-68a6fca49260	5	I bought this &#34;Pretty in Pink Girl Chihuahua salt & pepper shaker set&#34; for my sister for a Christmas present.  It is adorable.  She will love it.
71b6dd38-b9bb-49bb-a099-3d8f3d0aa07f	5	Beautiful ring! I love how it sparkles, and that, while it's a &#34;heart&#34; ring, it doesn't scream HEART in a juvenile, flashy, or over-the-top way. It's very elegant and classy, and the size 8 fits exactly as expected. I'm so excited about this gorgeous ring!
ec1a3edf-76d3-4ec0-8659-9ec2be5e66c0	5	Priced higher if compared to ikea price. But at least I didn't have to drive all the way to the store! I'd purchase again!
76fed137-afc9-4fa1-a24b-8bd6c9086244	5	I have been wearing this ring daily for about 3 months. I constantly wash my hands at work and the ring is still shiny.

2c15e478-7764-43c7-8378-50f903c28b88	5	Two months into it and it works like new. Easy cleanup and great nonstick quality

9b8c4f91-8683-4924-a10b-2bcf9cd31e7c	5	This comes complete with recipe cards and index cards. Good value. Looks nice. Good quality.
df4a557c-7be7-4cc1-ad94-4cbf5b4f1824	5	Just got these and am labeling everything in sight! They are so cute, stick on easily and are easy to write on! Looks like I'm going to need more! Carol
262612a3-7693-4291-b815-7534a8b2f832	5	Fits right in ur nose, I haven't worn it out yet but it has a tight grasp, especially if you push it up further, although it is smaller than I thought it would be.
6dbf90e0-518d-4694-a41f-efce8cc67724	5	This little item on my key chain is hardly noticeable.  It's very small but perfect for holding a half dozen nitro pills.  Just so you know, it's too small for a full size aspirin.  I'm glad I got it.
2ee86bb4-bdde-4b09-a5c6-33776de29a05	4	Over all I've very pleased with the machine after operating it.  I've owned several espresso machines over the years that were messy end results were so so.  The only down size I've seen so far is that the machine is not very consistent from shot to shot as far as volume. The guide says output should be 1.4 oz for a short and I've seen it shoot ,and I've seen it go from 1 oz to 1.4 oz . The issue seems to stem from the Rivo cups  not getting punctures at the bottom all the way. The frothing part of the machine works perfectly.
1ef31326-7983-43fd-87b4-5b51a3c00765	5	I loved this straw while it lasted. I used it for my hot tea in the monring. Unfortunately I dropped it on my kitchen floor and it shattered. I will definitely be ordering a replacement. Well worth the investment.
6ee1cda0-bbec-4709-8031-a107e8bb4434	5	Best bottle ever
e0a9c139-5739-4d7c-815e-4b75488374a9	1	Hard to apply and won't stay on the wall! Took forever to receive!
2c59cc9c-7a86-4df0-8b7c-a64027eba4c5	5	First let me start by saying this is the first flower gauges iv liked so I decided to go for it they were extremely nicely packed and when I looked at they they were amazing so worth the money and I am very happy
b95c9b15-d55a-4610-8e45-c4a2c6130356	5	I love these storage boxes.  I get my salads ready for work at the beginning of the week and don't have to worry that the romaine will be brown at the end of the week.  They seal well, so no accidents or spills. I have also stored open cucumbers without worry of early spoilage.  Herbs keep well.  Berries also.  Produce is expensive to throw out after just a few days. These little &#34;miracle&#34; green boxes help me save time and money.
4742e54c-6f9e-4059-b334-a7b1e6f967e1	5	My husband loved the replacement ring I purchased him. For the price, the quality was great. He likes it better than the white gold ring he lost.
1ba88839-00a4-47c2-87b3-aff9fbe6449d	5	Very pretty and received compliments on it.
ad6e14a5-face-4281-a2f6-9d241276746d	3	it's nice but Size is little Bigger.

a1a95bf4-4786-421a-8b0b-a1b367b0174e	5	This chain is absolutely gorgeous,  I wish i had bought more.  I will be back for sure!! It took a little longer to get but it still arrived before the expected delivery date. I hope more of these will be available!! For the price I can't believe how attractive this is. It's now my favorite stainless steel chain! Thank you!
08f39e61-0914-4e3b-8344-684d02379680	2	when i opened my plates the chemical smell was awful. i aired them out for two days and they still smell. i plan on soaking them over night, and if they still smell will need to return them.
28bccd02-2272-47c2-b666-9c1af9b605c9	5	It's shiny and beautiful.  I love it so much!  I was so excited for it to arrive and when it did I didn't think I could get the box open fast enough.  And it was even more wonderful than I expected.  It's just gorgeous.  Dainty.  Very shiny and beautiful patina.  The photos don't nearly do it justice.
872c6cd8-974b-417a-ae44-b085151359f2	5	used it ok but take time when you use it hold it steady
771d3df9-74bb-4afa-9fd1-f356f3a98495	5	I bought these as a birthday gift for my friend who lives in a another state. When she came to visit, she told me she loved them. Based on that, giving this a 5 rating
5f0999d7-7ef3-45ff-a8cd-ae77d448b104	4	I love this thing!  Still need to spray in some PAM before you drop the eggs in the cups, but once you do, and the eggs are done, you just flip the cups over and out the eggs come.  Short prep time, fast cooking and easy cleanup.
866d4f6d-6471-478a-a32f-791750041f39	1	Not worth buying....
c3eb3913-fe60-476e-b265-bee406c7ec69	3	The clip to keep the batteries in was broken when i got it. Otherwise worked great
da6778ea-e6e4-4b17-b7ec-5aa554f7dd2f	5	Just as advertised.  Love, Love, Love it.
29f9e887-f401-45e2-9b28-c1d2b7d384b8	2	was disapointed with it
150bd722-1fac-4517-99c6-df25e3eb0b10	5	Bought this for my daughter and I'm absolutely in love with it. ADORABLE
3a71095f-5b80-42d4-9352-35dc90328ee9	5	I put my mixeD powder in this with milk and it does the trick.
222e92eb-0fe5-47f9-8684-4e8bc9c91999	5	We own several Shun knives, to be honest, this blade is better. It has better edge retention and is very hard. The handle is excellent, this is my GO-TO knife. I use it for everything. Don't be scared, just get it. It is one purchase you will NEVER regret!
2ee6efe6-a41f-40a4-bf51-4c654906dd2e	5	Exactly what I was looking for.
78a7b74e-dd4e-4ef4-9818-2ec1f25b149d	5	Love it!
195c681f-d101-460d-8714-dda45eb4a4ef	5	I have had my Jack Lalanne juicer for almost eight years now.  It has been fabulous!  I have enjoyed using it and it is still going strong!  I don't love the clean up - but that is just my laziness.  I highly recommend this juicer!!
5a415c97-1263-49d6-a511-66672090a32f	1	The posts were already bent when I received them.  Very poorly made
f4f47c3e-bd82-4fe6-a8fa-27e72f0d4d10	5	Love this!  Use it for making ice tea :)
cc547c9b-2aa9-4687-9a47-c6b2e652a5aa	1	The pendant itself is beautiful but the necklace was broken in pieces.
c36bbb95-a45c-4748-96bf-62ec0f1846e5	4	Its a very nice piece for the price and it is not heavy.  The colors are very bright and you can wear it with several different colors of tops or dresses
9b38ce05-d944-467f-b881-7c5af8c52376	1	Received today and the box was completely empty!!  It was supposed to be a pair of earrings, but the foam in the empty box is for a ring.  This Prime Day thing has been a total failure.  I will be requesting my money back.
4e2e0f47-7237-4a78-9726-ebb220ba9e25	5	I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it.
91e068a8-bbde-423a-9d2c-8b10bd2ae3e3	5	Love it
03fa3a18-1846-4e77-ab3f-bdcdcf9e4513	4	I got this for my daughter's birthday, as she'd been saying that she wanted a music-themed necklace.  It's very pretty, but the one pictured is better quality than what I got.  The soldering in person is a good bit more evident than in the image, and the silver itself isn't as smooth.  I'm considering replacing the chain because as someone else noted, it came already partially tangled and will probably continue to tangle with wear.<br /><br />Still very pretty an a lot more eye catching than most of the other musical note jewelry to be found, without being gaudy.  The polishing cloth is a small, but appreciated bonus.
f823b09f-e6a5-40c2-ab6f-8409e8bd5c6b	5	Great for freezing fresh juice or fruit puree into healthy icee treats.
0a7c3e45-a112-42b6-a827-f77f5ad91ae9	1	Very light-weight ring, and the &#34;koa wood&#34; looked like a printed, pixelated picture.<br /><br />Alliteration aside, I will be returning this.
b269d473-151f-48d7-b9d1-5a755a327403	5	Love this product. Makes freezing corn so much easier
ae174371-0ac0-4a15-8470-b4fcf4ff9ab8	4	cheap
c25e523f-0b6e-4724-9660-2d954767ad3c	5	I am ordering my 2nd ActiFry today.  I put a priority on making vegetables for my family and this appliance allows me to make the roasted vegetables they all enjoy with out mess.  I LOVE it for roasted cauliflower, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts. Anything!  It cleans easily in the dishwasher. I use it almost daily and highly recommend it!
9f797c06-e168-4e6d-b77a-10ce1ceb73bc	2	Not a full ring.  It's open in the back.
65312d76-18f4-4157-b7d9-2bf795fc298b	5	Love it!  Easy to infuse, with the lift out container inside..easy to clean, dishwasher safe Phalate free.
eadc7bee-77e9-46cf-b46a-21606e58a6ed	5	I was going to send it back.  I did not realize it has a &#34;flim&#34; plastered over the display - it needs to be removed or you will not be able to see what you are doing!<br />Know that once you set the calendar, you can just toggle back and forth between 12 hr and 24 hr, which is nice.<br />I emailed cust service and they got back to me right away and gave me the phone # to call them if I still needed to.<br />Taking the protective film off eliminated by obvious problem, but I still had another question (12 vs. 24 hr clock).  So I called:  they answered on the first ring, then moved me to a queue and my wait was about 45 seconds.<br />TERRIFIC!<br />I bought two timers and knew I could send one back and get two of the same if I could only love one.  But I love them both:  this one and the Taylor one.
5b999de3-7248-4395-aaca-d56f42cef495	5	The ring is beautiful and it's what i expected<br />Thank You
4b3243ea-c27d-4d9e-9c6f-d219cd266d31	5	Nice knife, but the handle is pretty cheap for a Wusthof. Very nice sharpener.
88aaf95c-9ee6-4c5f-acbc-cec905f851c0	1	they should of been ashame to even sell it<br />it came broken, the stones did not fit in the mounting<br />I sent it back the day I got it
8059a81f-a5d5-4d59-a8cb-f365ca7a2f00	5	Love this little pink food processor. Have only used it to make rices cauliflower so far.
7fa25888-6a85-4eda-8510-ca0b8094b9bf	5	Made well and I love it!
d1d4442b-8f6e-479d-a780-eb800a0a6fda	3	It doesn't get as hot as some cheaper slice toasters.  So you have to turn it all the way up in order to get a light char on your multi-grain toast. And it takes a lot longer to toast. The pros are that it's pretty compact, handles four slices, and is attractive.
1fbfbbf9-bf62-4ee9-9083-c9808a85ac7d	5	This thing works WAY TOO GOOD. The rice I steam is SOOO delicious and the steamed foods are DELICIOUS! I'm on my way to start cooking stews and soups in it! :)
700664e4-d8ef-4a07-98d4-cd8e75535d97	4	Love using it, it gets the job done. I would have given 5 stars, but the arm that carries the yarn for the winder comes loose and falls in which I have to stop and fix it. Other than that it works great.
1f3f51e2-b970-4360-831b-64e052c1f03b	5	Nuff said.
3b9136af-e6f4-4fe8-bee1-a3a64ca054e7	1	I bought two of this kitchen timers and I'm so disappointed. It looks so cute but stop working after few days of use. So if you want as a decor in your kitchen it's fine but not for a timer. lol
d4778c2e-9cea-4443-b0fd-615f13e4a5ec	3	It's alright for the money I paid.  It gives me that burned rubber smell when I am making a smoothie.
f8ff7ad0-0eb8-4d69-9fdd-d87aecbb0d27	3	Generally nice and handy grinder I really like it, however the voltage is incompatible with my country even when I use a down voltage converter it still blow the motor. Service centre here is not able to provide replacement or servicing. Didn't have a chance to test with beans before it spoiled.
10327f41-cc0a-4c2e-ba62-203be668a4e3	5	Works great.  Washable.
4104232d-98fa-428c-b565-dd7f85792121	5	The packaging was superb, well protected, but not too bulky.  The glasses keep things colder longer and do not &#34;sweat&#34;.  The borosilicate has a different feel to it, but is quite nice after you get used to it.  I'll be buying more.
d560b147-9920-4cd3-aa4d-299a3514431b	3	I bought it for making making pie crust, duh. It is large enough to use if my baseball bat breaks. It cleans wells. It does the job.
c10ed89e-4a99-4fc7-b82d-b0b400d6014d	5	Love it
bed0ab71-557d-40d5-b4a7-8a63cdd30661	2	Chain broke the first time I wore it.  Disappointed in the quality.
8cf0b389-3033-49e3-88e8-79fc5c3aa13a	5	Beautiful!
f3f0bd20-5ed9-4220-b838-b28d7df0c7f1	5	I believe new beginnings style is nice and meaningful.
9b8b611b-05c6-4012-9c37-7fd6bf02e8fb	3	I want to return it because the ring dented and the shape is not fully round.
569af6de-d51f-419b-be01-45c9bfc29294	4	Sturdy and a great lid. Screws on easy and keeps the water cold. I got two of them for my boys who play tennis. I wish it came in different colors so they could easily tell whose is whose though!
c70cf489-22bf-4912-9fd9-a387cf15e0f0	1	My fiance and I bought this ring this past Christmas.... It has been eight months; ring is chipping and turning... I do not recommend this ring. And the only reason I even picked a star is because I had to...
c910b932-fbd4-4a5d-beaf-89054c3cc5df	5	Had the same one for many years.  Just replaced it with the same waffle maker!  Love it!
067fda12-a898-4d12-846c-0a98d42734b6	5	Good
c2273fa4-8a03-4fa3-b97e-c1ef73e976c4	5	looks great, lots of compliments<br />better quality than I excepted.
8cb52bf5-2c86-4e17-a063-6c85207ba922	4	Cute item for the price.
69068ffd-f995-4f4b-baf9-1698fc4b9a12	5	Great. Useful pan.
ae255001-97fb-4959-93f6-fc05d2d1b1e0	5	Very pretty. I have bought one in every color.
6b1c35c1-83f9-425f-8c11-3df32bd7de43	4	Works better than any cheap thermometer I've had, but it's still pretty slow. I was expecting something that would work in a matter of seconds, but it takes about a minute to get a temperature reading.
802f4ee7-b017-4c39-b9d5-7321496f07a6	5	Great product
90659100-f58e-415e-a389-9d8fa84204b5	5	I couldn't be happier with my chain.  Looks great and legit 36&#34;.
3e1d6e5a-992d-4c0b-b361-ef2a9df6d688	5	This kind of jar is the only real solution for pantry moths, in my opinion.  I put all pantry items in mason jars and the moths can't get in.
02048d7b-5d70-437e-a23c-ca5cbcfbd357	5	Everything came to with the exact items. I was very satisfied with my order and would definitely suggest this package and company.
883b7378-f733-4f73-9910-c6a82170d882	4	My wife has gotten so many compliments since she has been wearing this necklace. She has always been into Celtic jewelry.
ccfec946-c11e-43f4-ae0b-cb2fa616eaa2	5	Love it! Cute and arrived before it was scheduled to. Looks exactly like the picture!
aa0101e5-7d3c-4560-82f5-12c047f4651b	5	I am a 3-4 cup a day aeropress user and I love my new Slimm premium metal filter. It is sturdy and is very easy to clean. It has a very fine mesh and a good fit to the aeropress so no grounds leakage. I am so happy with the product, I bought one for my son too.
5420f885-e52f-4cde-8b11-876110299ae5	5	These are great for the price! They are very sparkly, appropriately sized (don't look way too big to be real), and don't irritate my ears.
7982ffce-b3c8-4dab-a1a2-e3cd429fea78	5	These trays are AWESOME!!! BIG CUBES!!! Great for iced tea and cocktails out here in Tucson, AZ. I definitely recommend these trays for anyone looking to keep it cool...
6ba86d0a-d5f4-4660-98c1-4d31f5dbe817	5	Perfect for runaway veggies or bread or whatever near the counter. I hung it on the wall above the counter and keep fruit etc in the friendly baskets.
0a8e8485-dee6-4cbf-9803-7413ace20c97	5	It os much easier to prepare jerk with it. Easy to clean.
3e78b304-b02f-426c-9e2a-287593aea1e8	5	LOVE LOVE LOVE-- they are very light on the lobes too!
a95739cd-aa4f-4cbd-b752-b6c1f583f62b	5	Bought these for my daughter for Christmas, as she loves Amber.  She loved them :)
ab4d76ae-ed22-4630-9afc-d0db02949c03	5	Great bracelet!! Love it! Fast ship too!
73c6f830-7d7c-4ed5-9805-15baa3de97fe	5	This ice chest went above my expectations! It holds ice really well It has enough room for whatever you need. Although,  it is a bit heavy when full, but movable!  I would definitely recommend it!
cbb67e27-5c16-43f1-a725-a94e52922264	1	I have the original kuerig and am looking to upgrade to one that offers cold coffee drinks. Haven't seen any reviews on how this one does with that?
bbda2255-009f-4e54-ba4a-7f0df689a3a9	4	Kids love it.  Just be sure not to jam to much food in or it won't cook all the way through.
6a119ac0-8a06-4cd1-85bb-46dc64c388b7	5	Awesome!
7aedf762-f413-4b5c-820e-20965e99e9da	5	Oh so cute! My girlfriend loved hers & now we have something to represent our friendship! Very neat. Love Alex and Ani!
838a9902-f7af-4414-ac03-0ec2da33a174	5	Love them
1685a6a2-a482-4d5c-bbfa-beff6f31a36c	5	A+++
7cd5891e-b4a7-4765-8879-5bddfc1eae40	5	exactly as described and fits in some of my bento boxes
28cc0d9d-2ff0-45ee-ade0-c182b4ec5e1a	3	I was looking for the 40oz.
af1cb938-5a85-44d6-929e-7d0683086f1a	4	They are beautiful.
c78044fe-d5d7-4132-a1ed-af4359b2a6d1	5	My daughter loves these big costume rings, I'm sure she will love this one too. Came gift boxed, very nice!
2b8c9707-0b88-4ca5-b5c6-5c286e6d001f	3	took more than a few weeks to get them. I almost forgot that I ordered them but the quality is OK the gems fall out after a couple of weeks.
661302d8-c7de-418b-9d03-3fc0217b46b2	4	Pretty good product.  Is a bit narrow, but keeps the butter nicely.  Would buy again.
4605d3bb-a3ef-4c14-a5d8-8ee49634cc0e	4	They work well it your drink is chilled first.
bc7e479f-c4c0-40f6-973c-4eaa5ae680a9	1	After a week of my fiancee wearing it a diamond fell of took to jewelry to get fixed ... they fixed that one when they polished it more diamonds starting falling out.
df4fb301-6c31-4c99-8977-0a8c7801bc19	5	It's more beautiful in person and for the price it is 100% worth it! I am impressed it stayed together for an entire festival.
c7f3f86a-1de7-4ee4-8b75-96228b9d6bba	4	Had a small flaw in the middle/large bead but overall beautiful.
3a9eaa75-41fe-4140-b7bb-c8f70badfcf7	5	Love the Chef'n Biggie Chopper so much I order one for my RV. This makes the 3rd Chopper got this one for my daughter's Christmas.
002c7a2c-d07b-40e4-83d2-140d18db5387	3	Fairly flimsy.  Not sure what I expected for the price, but could have accomplished this with some paper and a stick.  I really thought the arrow would be &#34;stiff&#34; and made of some kind of corrugated cardboard.
fc151034-9330-40d6-8dce-8207ec78c3bf	2	It could hardly hold one T- Bone steak.
ca944bb8-fe2b-444f-92dc-4726e434c197	4	The fry cutter was what I was looking for and works great
737082ee-9363-4c80-98ef-1f2cd25a27d1	2	These are really hard to put in....there a little short also so there tight on your nose!
b7856c82-500f-4cbc-a790-4a931a20f8c5	5	I love this tea kettle! It is extremely well made. I like the style very much.  The burnished stainless steel exterior doesn't show water spots as easily as polished stainless steel.  I love the coated interior.  My well-water contains a lot of minerals and my last tea kettle's interior would be covered in lime within a week.  So far (almost a month of use), there isn't a spec of lime buildup.  The handle is high to make filling easy and the padding is comfortable to grip.  I only have one TINY gripe... the whistle is not as loud as my old kettle.  Nonetheless, I would not give up this tea kettle for any other.
877bf80b-f1fc-42f9-9d8b-8b7f523d426d	5	it's my favorite pitcher
212ef621-603f-4911-9c36-8d0f369250c7	5	Awesome product with lots of measurements. Plastic, not glass, so keep it our of the dishwasher.
c0eddca4-8ad8-4ca5-9ab1-404050dde240	5	Keeps your good hot for a long time. Very convenient and sturdy.
d8969393-3567-4cc7-a979-2373c8725738	5	So handy and feel good in the hand.
